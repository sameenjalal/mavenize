All he needed was a stool and a glass of something and he was in his element, reflecting laconically on such subjects as sex, the Irish and God, traffic, smoking, the Bible, Life and Death. Also sex, the Irish and God... This DVD contains his very own personal choice of sketches, gags and monologues. It's a vintage display from a unique raconteur - a man who observes out guilt, weaknesses and doubts and makes us laugh at them and at ourselves.","released":"2005-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":133,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/6Sm7UOv9Sl4HGWFhF4v7N6BZOiO.jpg","id":"4ea6a95d34f8633bdc00e441"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":223,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/6Sm7UOv9Sl4HGWFhF4v7N6BZOiO.jpg","id":"4ea6a95d34f8633bdc00e441"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":267,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/6Sm7UOv9Sl4HGWFhF4v7N6BZOiO.jpg","id":"4ea6a95d34f8633bdc00e441"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":494,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6Sm7UOv9Sl4HGWFhF4v7N6BZOiO.jpg","id":"4ea6a95d34f8633bdc00e441"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":723,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/6Sm7UOv9Sl4HGWFhF4v7N6BZOiO.jpg","id":"4ea6a95d34f8633bdc00e441"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":578,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6Sm7UOv9Sl4HGWFhF4v7N6BZOiO.jpg","id":"4ea6a95d34f8633bdc00e441"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":37,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 15:56:27 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Dave Attell: Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour - Uncensored","name":"Dave Attell: Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour - Uncensored","alternative_name":"Insomniac with Dave Attell","movie_type":"movie","id":36607,"imdb_id":"tt1869360","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/36607","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"Unrated","overview":"Inspired by Dave Attell's popular Comedy Central series, this concert movie deposits him and three fellow comics, including the wildly popular Dane Cook, at the House of Blues in Las Vegas to deliver some raucous and frequently funny material before an appreciative crowd.

Rouse takes the easy route with jokes aimed straight for the heart of the rowdy audience (sex, booze, drugs), Giraldo mixes gags based around fatherhood with some political humor, while Cook, whose status has blossomed to near-superstardom thanks to tours like this, is broad and fairly foul-mouthed, but gives an engagingly manic performance, which is well received by the heavily lubricated twenty-something crowd.","released":"2003-02-04","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":132,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/gfYjuoIgznB37807mpTlgva4t3X.jpg","id":"4ea662642c058837cb009c01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":221,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/gfYjuoIgznB37807mpTlgva4t3X.jpg","id":"4ea662642c058837cb009c01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":265,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/gfYjuoIgznB37807mpTlgva4t3X.jpg","id":"4ea662642c058837cb009c01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":490,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/gfYjuoIgznB37807mpTlgva4t3X.jpg","id":"4ea662642c058837cb009c01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":716,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/gfYjuoIgznB37807mpTlgva4t3X.jpg","id":"4ea662642c058837cb009c01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":954,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/gfYjuoIgznB37807mpTlgva4t3X.jpg","id":"4ea662642c058837cb009c01"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":63,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:00:07 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Dave Chappelle: HBO Comedy Half-Hour","name":"Dave Chappelle: HBO Comedy Half-Hour","alternative_name":"Dave Chappelle HBO Special","movie_type":"movie","id":35595,"imdb_id":"tt0876707","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/35595","votes":1,"rating":9.0,"certification":"R","overview":"Dve gets his own HBO special, filmed in San Francisco","released":"1998-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":115,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/7DHCfSvZF9O3KnOuUixBfcKNBgb.jpg","id":"4ea66eba34f8633bdc00960d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":192,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/7DHCfSvZF9O3KnOuUixBfcKNBgb.jpg","id":"4ea66eba34f8633bdc00960d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":231,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/7DHCfSvZF9O3KnOuUixBfcKNBgb.jpg","id":"4ea66eba34f8633bdc00960d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":427,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/7DHCfSvZF9O3KnOuUixBfcKNBgb.jpg","id":"4ea66eba34f8633bdc00960d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":624,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/7DHCfSvZF9O3KnOuUixBfcKNBgb.jpg","id":"4ea66eba34f8633bdc00960d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":231,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/7DHCfSvZF9O3KnOuUixBfcKNBgb.jpg","id":"4ea66eba34f8633bdc00960d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":225,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/ktnfGpTDooBuZMz5zIpduAsl9Ip.jpg","id":"4ea66eb934f8633bdc00960b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":585,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/ktnfGpTDooBuZMz5zIpduAsl9Ip.jpg","id":"4ea66eb934f8633bdc00960b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":960,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/ktnfGpTDooBuZMz5zIpduAsl9Ip.jpg","id":"4ea66eb934f8633bdc00960b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":270,"width":360,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/ktnfGpTDooBuZMz5zIpduAsl9Ip.jpg","id":"4ea66eb934f8633bdc00960b"}}],"version":42,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 15:21:23 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly","name":"Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly","alternative_name":"Dave Chappelle -
