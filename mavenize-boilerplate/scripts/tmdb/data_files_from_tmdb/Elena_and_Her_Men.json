When Elena elicits the fascination of a famous general, she finds herself at the center of romantic machinations and political scheming, with the hearts of several men—as well as the future of France—in her hands.","released":"1956-09-12","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":128,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/wRoojodjCIwTOtUnY2C4UGIf7tl.jpg","id":"4ea69d189dc3d83c3b00c721"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":214,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/wRoojodjCIwTOtUnY2C4UGIf7tl.jpg","id":"4ea69d189dc3d83c3b00c721"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":257,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wRoojodjCIwTOtUnY2C4UGIf7tl.jpg","id":"4ea69d189dc3d83c3b00c721"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":476,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/wRoojodjCIwTOtUnY2C4UGIf7tl.jpg","id":"4ea69d189dc3d83c3b00c721"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":696,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/wRoojodjCIwTOtUnY2C4UGIf7tl.jpg","id":"4ea69d189dc3d83c3b00c721"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1437,"width":1033,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/wRoojodjCIwTOtUnY2C4UGIf7tl.jpg","id":"4ea69d189dc3d83c3b00c721"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":84,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 17:26:40 UTC"}]
