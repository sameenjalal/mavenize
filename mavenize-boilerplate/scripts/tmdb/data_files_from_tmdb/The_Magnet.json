Earthâ€™s invisible shield? Magnets have the power to attract and repelâ€”sometimes on a massive scale. The Earthâ€™s molten coreâ€”a violent mix of searing heat, crushing pressure, and a billion trillion tons of liquid ironâ€”creates an invisible shield that surrounds the globe, guarding against a constant barrage of deadly radiation from space. But over the last few decades, the Earthâ€™s magnetic field has weakened dramatically, intriguing scientists across the globe. The power generated 2000 miles beneath our feet protects us every day, but the loss of Earthâ€™s magnetic field is a brewing storm that affects us all. While experts research and debate, persistent questions remain. Is a rare geomagnetic reversal the cause of earthâ€™s inner turmoil? And if the magnetic field were to vanish altogether, would Earth become as lifeless as Mars?","released":"2003-10-27","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":116,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/mqUWw4cKE3GbKsPC0o7T02A4pIb.jpg","id":"4ea6a22a34f8633bdc00d8c7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":195,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/mqUWw4cKE3GbKsPC0o7T02A4pIb.jpg","id":"4ea6a22a34f8633bdc00d8c7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":234,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/mqUWw4cKE3GbKsPC0o7T02A4pIb.jpg","id":"4ea6a22a34f8633bdc00d8c7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":433,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/mqUWw4cKE3GbKsPC0o7T02A4pIb.jpg","id":"4ea6a22a34f8633bdc00d8c7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":633,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/mqUWw4cKE3GbKsPC0o7T02A4pIb.jpg","id":"4ea6a22a34f8633bdc00d8c7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":843,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mqUWw4cKE3GbKsPC0o7T02A4pIb.jpg","id":"4ea6a22a34f8633bdc00d8c7"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/xKUej9fnBncCBDlTjOU7LObmTuB.jpg","id":"4ea6a22c34f8633bdc00d8c9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/xKUej9fnBncCBDlTjOU7LObmTuB.jpg","id":"4ea6a22c34f8633bdc00d8c9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/xKUej9fnBncCBDlTjOU7LObmTuB.jpg","id":"4ea6a22c34f8633bdc00d8c9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/xKUej9fnBncCBDlTjOU7LObmTuB.jpg","id":"4ea6a22c34f8633bdc00d8c9"}}],"version":217,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 16:22:47 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"L'aÃ®nÃ© des Ferchaux","name":"Magnet of Doom","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":69729,"imdb_id":"tt0056845","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/69729","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":null,"overview":"A young boxer Michel Maudet is sacked by his manager after a series of match defeats and is forced to look for a new job.
