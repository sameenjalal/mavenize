Banding together to fight gurellia-style agaist the enemy, this is not a typical heroic war movie - it is a terrifying situation where they must sometimes use little more than a knife or a belt to murder a soldier in cold blood. It's a graphic tale of the violence, the blood, the fear, and the insanity of war. These kids are underdogs, they're not going to win the war, they're more likely to end up dead in a ditch than send the enemy retreating, but it's their land, their parents and friends in prison camps.
