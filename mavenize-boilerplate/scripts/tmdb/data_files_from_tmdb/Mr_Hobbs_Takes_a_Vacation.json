Renting a cottage by the ocean is just the first step in a summer fraught with disasters, including a couch potato son, a shy daughter with newly installed braces, a pair of grown daughters who have married badly, and a local yachtsman with eyes for Peggy. Not to mention the ramshackle state of the shoreline abode, Roger and Peggy's new grandparent status, and incidents involving a sexy neighbor, a sailboat regatta and bird watching. ~ Karl Williams, All Movie Guide","released":"1962-06-15","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":140,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg","id":"4ea6851d9dc3d83c3b00a775"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":235,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg","id":"4ea6851d9dc3d83c3b00a775"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":282,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg","id":"4ea6851d9dc3d83c3b00a775"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":521,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg","id":"4ea6851d9dc3d83c3b00a775"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":762,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg","id":"4ea6851d9dc3d83c3b00a775"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1015,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/nyJSh7VSRXsO31nIzLHD6wcfcDT.jpg","id":"4ea6851d9dc3d83c3b00a775"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/tryXg3xx9rV16bdpXVq7NRASClJ.jpg","id":"4ea685229dc3d83c3b00a779"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/tryXg3xx9rV16bdpXVq7NRASClJ.jpg","id":"4ea685229dc3d83c3b00a779"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/tryXg3xx9rV16bdpXVq7NRASClJ.jpg","id":"4ea685229dc3d83c3b00a779"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/tryXg3xx9rV16bdpXVq7NRASClJ.jpg","id":"4ea685229dc3d83c3b00a779"}}],"version":362,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:02:58 UTC"}]
