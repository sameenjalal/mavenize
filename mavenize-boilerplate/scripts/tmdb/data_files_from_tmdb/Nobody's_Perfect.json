Alexandra is beautiful, intelligent, rich, and completely insufferable. Self-centered and patronizing, she’s an expert in quick put-downs, nasty name-calling, and brokering gossip into profit. Alexis is a simple-minded, pure-hearted, and hard-working gal who is constantly bullied by her future sister-in-law’s family with whom she stays. Crossing paths again by chance, the two girls don’t want anything to do with each other – until a freak accident causes them to switch bodies!","released":"2008-11-27","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/qaX3SIXsRAm5wXQTjgzuiaNQ5wC.jpg","id":"4ea6a8a82c058837cb01006b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/qaX3SIXsRAm5wXQTjgzuiaNQ5wC.jpg","id":"4ea6a8a82c058837cb01006b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/qaX3SIXsRAm5wXQTjgzuiaNQ5wC.jpg","id":"4ea6a8a82c058837cb01006b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/qaX3SIXsRAm5wXQTjgzuiaNQ5wC.jpg","id":"4ea6a8a82c058837cb01006b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/qaX3SIXsRAm5wXQTjgzuiaNQ5wC.jpg","id":"4ea6a8a82c058837cb01006b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":666,"width":450,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/qaX3SIXsRAm5wXQTjgzuiaNQ5wC.jpg","id":"4ea6a8a82c058837cb01006b"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":75,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 03:45:53 UTC"}]
