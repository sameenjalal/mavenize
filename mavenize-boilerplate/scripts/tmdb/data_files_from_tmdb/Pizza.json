Iedereen kent ze als Bram en Haas, de twee snelste koeriers van pizzeria Novara. De twee jongens zijn onafscheidelijk. Elke avond racen ze op hun scooter door de stad en halen de bruutste stunts uit om als eerste bij de klant te zijn. De pizzeria is eigendom van Brams vader, maar sinds hij met een hernia thuis zit, runt oom Faris de tent. Faris, de vader van Haas, is een geboren pizzabakker en de bestellingen vliegen dan ook de deur uit. Toch blijken de inkomsten tegen te vallen. De vader van Bram verdenkt zijn broer ervan dat hij geld achterhoudt. Als hij hem hiermee confronteert, ontstaat er een heftige ruzie en Faris vertrekt. Tot op het bot gekrenkt begint de trotse Faris vervolgens zijn eigen pizzeria, aan de overkant van het plein. Binnen no-time breekt er tussen de twee pizzeria?s een ware pizza-oorlog uit, waarin alles en iedereen wordt meegesleept.","released":"2011-02-17","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/h3C0JInBJPL7UAYktgRP7Jdy7Yn.jpg","id":"4ea6b1bd9dc3d83c3b00e609"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":218,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/h3C0JInBJPL7UAYktgRP7Jdy7Yn.jpg","id":"4ea6b1bd9dc3d83c3b00e609"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/h3C0JInBJPL7UAYktgRP7Jdy7Yn.jpg","id":"4ea6b1bd9dc3d83c3b00e609"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":483,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/h3C0JInBJPL7UAYktgRP7Jdy7Yn.jpg","id":"4ea6b1bd9dc3d83c3b00e609"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":707,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/h3C0JInBJPL7UAYktgRP7Jdy7Yn.jpg","id":"4ea6b1bd9dc3d83c3b00e609"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1600,"width":1132,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/h3C0JInBJPL7UAYktgRP7Jdy7Yn.jpg","id":"4ea6b1bd9dc3d83c3b00e609"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":168,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/eXJ3IB12aggOTjmnx2I3xyuURYe.jpg","id":"4ea6b1be9dc3d83c3b00e60b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":437,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/eXJ3IB12aggOTjmnx2I3xyuURYe.jpg","id":"4ea6b1be9dc3d83c3b00e60b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":718,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/eXJ3IB12aggOTjmnx2I3xyuURYe.jpg","id":"4ea6b1be9dc3d83c3b00e60b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":897,"width":1600,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/eXJ3IB12aggOTjmnx2I3xyuURYe.jpg","id":"4ea6b1be9dc3d83c3b00e60b"}}],"version":52,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 15:08:03 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Fat Pizza","name":"Fat Pizza","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":15603,"imdb_id":"tt0340110","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/15603","votes":1,"rating":6.0,"certification":"","overview":"Fat Pizza the Film is yet another slice of life at a dodgy suburban Sydney take away.
