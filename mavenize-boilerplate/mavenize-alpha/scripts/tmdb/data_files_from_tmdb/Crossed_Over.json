It was supposed to be an ordinary evening, but it became a night that defined Iverson's young life. A quarrel soon erupted into a brawl pitting Iverson's young black friends against a group of white patrons. The fallout from the fight and the handling of the subsequent trial landed the teenager-considered by some the nation's best high school athlete-in jail and sharply divided the city along racial lines. Steve James (\"Hoop Dreams\") returns to his hometown of Hampton, where he once played basketball, to take a personal look at this still-disputed incident and examine its impact on Iverson and the shared community.","released":"2010-04-10","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":135,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/wcJRjO2lTGDMNdATGf0wI5SLNYE.jpg","id":"4ea682204f13c137cc00a3ed"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":225,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/wcJRjO2lTGDMNdATGf0wI5SLNYE.jpg","id":"4ea682204f13c137cc00a3ed"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":271,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wcJRjO2lTGDMNdATGf0wI5SLNYE.jpg","id":"4ea682204f13c137cc00a3ed"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":501,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/wcJRjO2lTGDMNdATGf0wI5SLNYE.jpg","id":"4ea682204f13c137cc00a3ed"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":732,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/wcJRjO2lTGDMNdATGf0wI5SLNYE.jpg","id":"4ea682204f13c137cc00a3ed"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":981,"width":670,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/wcJRjO2lTGDMNdATGf0wI5SLNYE.jpg","id":"4ea682204f13c137cc00a3ed"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":190,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/cW0NOlCD8NQPiaNqvcGFMVQGgdm.jpg","id":"4ea682214f13c137cc00a3ef"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":495,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/cW0NOlCD8NQPiaNqvcGFMVQGgdm.jpg","id":"4ea682214f13c137cc00a3ef"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":812,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/cW0NOlCD8NQPiaNqvcGFMVQGgdm.jpg","id":"4ea682214f13c137cc00a3ef"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1379,"width":2173,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/cW0NOlCD8NQPiaNqvcGFMVQGgdm.jpg","id":"4ea682214f13c137cc00a3ef"}}],"version":236,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 07:25:15 UTC"}]
