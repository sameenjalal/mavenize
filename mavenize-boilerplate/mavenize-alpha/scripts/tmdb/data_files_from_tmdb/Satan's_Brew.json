Unable to write enough to keep his publisher's royalty advances coming, he seeks out a woman he imagines is a prostitute and interviews her for material. He is also inspired to utter some poetry, which his brassy, outspoken wife identifies as coming from the famous homosexuality-advocating mystical German poet, Stefan George. This inspires Walter to take a closer look at the gay scene, and he quickly becomes a sort of celebrity there.","released":"1976-10-07","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/3kBjGuNbsS5szUFah4Vpp0pyDEp.jpg","id":"4ea6647a2c058837cb009ed3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/3kBjGuNbsS5szUFah4Vpp0pyDEp.jpg","id":"4ea6647a2c058837cb009ed3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":260,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/3kBjGuNbsS5szUFah4Vpp0pyDEp.jpg","id":"4ea6647a2c058837cb009ed3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/3kBjGuNbsS5szUFah4Vpp0pyDEp.jpg","id":"4ea6647a2c058837cb009ed3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":704,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/3kBjGuNbsS5szUFah4Vpp0pyDEp.jpg","id":"4ea6647a2c058837cb009ed3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1408,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/3kBjGuNbsS5szUFah4Vpp0pyDEp.jpg","id":"4ea6647a2c058837cb009ed3"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":183,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/61EpXiTCKNQqOmsGX1dQ3b6Kvoa.jpg","id":"4f19e8e519c29501e400203d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":475,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/61EpXiTCKNQqOmsGX1dQ3b6Kvoa.jpg","id":"4f19e8e519c29501e400203d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":780,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/61EpXiTCKNQqOmsGX1dQ3b6Kvoa.jpg","id":"4f19e8e519c29501e400203d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":780,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/61EpXiTCKNQqOmsGX1dQ3b6Kvoa.jpg","id":"4f19e8e519c29501e400203d"}}],"version":98,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-24 01:31:43 UTC"}]
