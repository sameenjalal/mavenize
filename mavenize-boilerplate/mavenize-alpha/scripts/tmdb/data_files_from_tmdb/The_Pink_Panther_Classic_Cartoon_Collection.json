He only becomes flustered or angry at obtuse or offensive humans who try to disrupt his existence, or at troublesome gadgets, rodents, or insects. In most of his cartoons, he stumbles into a difficult situation and stoically endeavors to make the best of it. Episodes of this series feature three theatrical cartoons, two with the Pink Panther, and one featuring the Inspector, a cartoon version of the accident-prone, bumbling French detective, Inspector Clouseau, played in movies by Peter Sellers. The Inspector is often assisted by a Spanish gendarme, Sergeant Deux-Deux, and together they fallibly battle villains of all shapes and sizes in various parts of the world, always on the orders of the long-suffering Surete Commissioner.","released":"2009-01-27","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/mJMe3o2SE6DDt9xwJtGC1Uewve4.jpg","id":"4ea694812c058837cb00df69"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/mJMe3o2SE6DDt9xwJtGC1Uewve4.jpg","id":"4ea694812c058837cb00df69"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":260,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/mJMe3o2SE6DDt9xwJtGC1Uewve4.jpg","id":"4ea694812c058837cb00df69"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":480,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/mJMe3o2SE6DDt9xwJtGC1Uewve4.jpg","id":"4ea694812c058837cb00df69"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":702,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/mJMe3o2SE6DDt9xwJtGC1Uewve4.jpg","id":"4ea694812c058837cb00df69"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":618,"width":440,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mJMe3o2SE6DDt9xwJtGC1Uewve4.jpg","id":"4ea694812c058837cb00df69"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/cpKWNgJyKfArCESvweM5YjMTdML.jpg","id":"4ea694822c058837cb00df6b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/cpKWNgJyKfArCESvweM5YjMTdML.jpg","id":"4ea694822c058837cb00df6b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/cpKWNgJyKfArCESvweM5YjMTdML.jpg","id":"4ea694822c058837cb00df6b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/cpKWNgJyKfArCESvweM5YjMTdML.jpg","id":"4ea694822c058837cb00df6b"}}],"version":371,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 15:34:14 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection","name":"The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":75443,"imdb_id":null,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/75443","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"G","overview":"The Pink Panther is - paws down - the world's grooviest cartoon star. In 1964, this pink-inked feline slinked onto the opening credits of Blake Edwards' caper film by the same name and threatened to steal the entire show. Sleek, sophisticated and witty, the animation, produced by Friz Freleng and David H. DePatie, was a stylish departure from its contemporaries…and an instant hit. A subsequent short film, The Pink Phink, would go on to win* an Oscar® and spawn a celebrated series of six-minute cartoons featuring the sly cat. Now, for the first time, 124 cartoons produced by Freleng and DePatie between 1964 and 1980 are collected here in a swingin' 5-disc set. With over 14 hours of \"pink comedy,\" you can't help but lick your whiskers!","released":"2006-01-31","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":92,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/zhzYMRtgKKQeiBI3AtcIvx32gJL.jpg","id":"4ea739c734f863633c007b63"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":154,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/zhzYMRtgKKQeiBI3AtcIvx32gJL.jpg","id":"4ea739c734f863633c007b63"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":185,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/zhzYMRtgKKQeiBI3AtcIvx32gJL.jpg","id":"4ea739c734f863633c007b63"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":342,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/zhzYMRtgKKQeiBI3AtcIvx32gJL.jpg","id":"4ea739c734f863633c007b63"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":500,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/zhzYMRtgKKQeiBI3AtcIvx32gJL.jpg","id":"4ea739c734f863633c007b63"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":400,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/zhzYMRtgKKQeiBI3AtcIvx32gJL.jpg","id":"4ea739c734f863633c007b63"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 15:11:40 UTC"}]
