Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary, Summer (Deschanel), Tom discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love the Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Tom is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Tom believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Tom summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real.","released":"2009-07-17","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/lUh47eMBKUq1OaBkNY27L3gPS6F.jpg","id":"4ea67a6aa34d4b4a4f002ffd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/lUh47eMBKUq1OaBkNY27L3gPS6F.jpg","id":"4ea67a6aa34d4b4a4f002ffd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/lUh47eMBKUq1OaBkNY27L3gPS6F.jpg","id":"4ea67a6aa34d4b4a4f002ffd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/lUh47eMBKUq1OaBkNY27L3gPS6F.jpg","id":"4ea67a6aa34d4b4a4f002ffd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/lUh47eMBKUq1OaBkNY27L3gPS6F.jpg","id":"4ea67a6aa34d4b4a4f002ffd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/lUh47eMBKUq1OaBkNY27L3gPS6F.jpg","id":"4ea67a6aa34d4b4a4f002ffd"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/yYw9cVdRJ4zzwxM2cTDXfT6JI6E.jpg","id":"4ea67a3da34d4b4a4f002fdb"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/yYw9cVdRJ4zzwxM2cTDXfT6JI6E.jpg","id":"4ea67a3da34d4b4a4f002fdb"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/yYw9cVdRJ4zzwxM2cTDXfT6JI6E.jpg","id":"4ea67a3da34d4b4a4f002fdb"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/yYw9cVdRJ4zzwxM2cTDXfT6JI6E.jpg","id":"4ea67a3da34d4b4a4f002fdb"}}],"version":726,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-24 05:39:32 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Genova","name":"A Summer In Genoa","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":12408,"imdb_id":"tt0791303","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/12408","votes":2,"rating":4.8,"certification":"","overview":"A man moves his two daughters to Italy after their mother dies in a car accident, in order to revitalize their lives.
