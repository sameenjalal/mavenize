In the first, Karen Nash tries to get her inattentive husband Sam's attention to spruce up their failing marriage. In the second, brash film producer Jesse Kiplinger tries to get his former one-time flame Muriel to see him for what he stands for. In the third, Roy Hubley and his wife Norma try and try to get their uncertain-of-herself daughter out of the bathroom before her approaching wedding.","released":"1971-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/18haTIVMnM4AhO9UW6xawkp1puY.jpg","id":"4eab10cc5e73d606d200014c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":232,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/18haTIVMnM4AhO9UW6xawkp1puY.jpg","id":"4eab10cc5e73d606d200014c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/18haTIVMnM4AhO9UW6xawkp1puY.jpg","id":"4eab10cc5e73d606d200014c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":515,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/18haTIVMnM4AhO9UW6xawkp1puY.jpg","id":"4eab10cc5e73d606d200014c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":752,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/18haTIVMnM4AhO9UW6xawkp1puY.jpg","id":"4eab10cc5e73d606d200014c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":997,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/18haTIVMnM4AhO9UW6xawkp1puY.jpg","id":"4eab10cc5e73d606d200014c"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":335,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:20:29 UTC"}]
