Raised in her grandmother's brothel, Piaf was discovered in 1935 by nightclub owner Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu), who persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness. Piaf became one of France's immortal icons, her voice one of the indelible signatures of the 20th Century.","released":"2007-02-08","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/bXVhDcGNBwsC9xqWhtCUX8TbCsk.jpg","id":"4ea5e2682c058837cb001309"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":220,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/bXVhDcGNBwsC9xqWhtCUX8TbCsk.jpg","id":"4ea5e2682c058837cb001309"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":264,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/bXVhDcGNBwsC9xqWhtCUX8TbCsk.jpg","id":"4ea5e2682c058837cb001309"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":489,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/bXVhDcGNBwsC9xqWhtCUX8TbCsk.jpg","id":"4ea5e2682c058837cb001309"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":714,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/bXVhDcGNBwsC9xqWhtCUX8TbCsk.jpg","id":"4ea5e2682c058837cb001309"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1337,"width":936,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/bXVhDcGNBwsC9xqWhtCUX8TbCsk.jpg","id":"4ea5e2682c058837cb001309"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/ue507qDmtiULJNQjwNz9943LAS2.jpg","id":"4ea5e2532c058837cb0012f7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/ue507qDmtiULJNQjwNz9943LAS2.jpg","id":"4ea5e2532c058837cb0012f7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/ue507qDmtiULJNQjwNz9943LAS2.jpg","id":"4ea5e2532c058837cb0012f7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/ue507qDmtiULJNQjwNz9943LAS2.jpg","id":"4ea5e2532c058837cb0012f7"}}],"version":499,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 05:21:54 UTC"},{"score":0.95026433,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Lifeforce","name":"Lifeforce","alternative_name":"ForÃ§a Sinistra","movie_type":"movie","id":11954,"imdb_id":"tt0089489","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11954","votes":1,"rating":7.0,"certification":"R","overview":"A space shuttle mission investigating Halley's Comet brings back a malevolent race of space vampires who transform most of London's population into zombies.
