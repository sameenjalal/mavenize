What they don't know is they have actually been abducted by a KGB operative and flown to the Soviet Union, where they'll unwittingly serve as \"experts\" on all things cool in America. The town, created expressly for KGB spies-in-training is meant to serve as a training ground for Soviet agents. What can these two hapless Americans possibly teach the Soviet spies and will they ever learn they are not actually in Nebraska?","released":"1989-01-13","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":140,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/mENSWZHd5akzymCB7jgN7GsRxvW.jpg","id":"4ea6a58f4f13c137cc00d363"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":235,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/mENSWZHd5akzymCB7jgN7GsRxvW.jpg","id":"4ea6a58f4f13c137cc00d363"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":282,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/mENSWZHd5akzymCB7jgN7GsRxvW.jpg","id":"4ea6a58f4f13c137cc00d363"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":521,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/mENSWZHd5akzymCB7jgN7GsRxvW.jpg","id":"4ea6a58f4f13c137cc00d363"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":762,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/mENSWZHd5akzymCB7jgN7GsRxvW.jpg","id":"4ea6a58f4f13c137cc00d363"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":990,"width":650,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mENSWZHd5akzymCB7jgN7GsRxvW.jpg","id":"4ea6a58f4f13c137cc00d363"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":272,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 18:30:41 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Sexperts: Touched by Temptation","name":"The Sexperts: Touched by Temptation","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":87876,"imdb_id":"tt0183762","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/87876","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"A writer, a producer, and a director are having a meeting to discuss and plan scenes for their current film project: The story of Liz Adams, who has come to New York to seek fame and fortune through the theatre.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":140,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/6nRv0P9jkuzHchozJRVmDSRUJ8l.jpg","id":"4f328ef7760ee307b9000fe5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":235,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/6nRv0P9jkuzHchozJRVmDSRUJ8l.jpg","id":"4f328ef7760ee307b9000fe5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":282,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/6nRv0P9jkuzHchozJRVmDSRUJ8l.jpg","id":"4f328ef7760ee307b9000fe5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":522,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6nRv0P9jkuzHchozJRVmDSRUJ8l.jpg","id":"4f328ef7760ee307b9000fe5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":763,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/6nRv0P9jkuzHchozJRVmDSRUJ8l.jpg","id":"4f328ef7760ee307b9000fe5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":763,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6nRv0P9jkuzHchozJRVmDSRUJ8l.jpg","id":"4f328ef7760ee307b9000fe5"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 20:59:26 UTC"}]
