When Rangga wins the school poetry competition, Cinta, who also writes poetry and helps edit the student Bulletin Board, wants to interview him, but meets with refusal. Rangga is passionate about the literature of his country, but is alienated from his fellow students due to the break up of his parents' marriage and the political oppression of his father.
