Santa vs. The Snowman tells the story of a lonely Snowman who at first is swept away by the magical wonders of Santa's Village, only to ultimately wage war on Santa because he's jealous of all the attention Santa gets during Christmas time. An epic-scale polar war develops. The hilarious battle features such holiday defence mechanisms as hot chocolate squirt guns, giant Igloo Robot Walkers and even a 50-foot tall toy soldier manned by Santa himself.","released":"2002-11-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/lZTmtSh4fdkFgMo8zXrAhuPnTrX.jpg","id":"4ea6495034f8633bdc006f67"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":205,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/lZTmtSh4fdkFgMo8zXrAhuPnTrX.jpg","id":"4ea6495034f8633bdc006f67"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":247,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/lZTmtSh4fdkFgMo8zXrAhuPnTrX.jpg","id":"4ea6495034f8633bdc006f67"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":456,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/lZTmtSh4fdkFgMo8zXrAhuPnTrX.jpg","id":"4ea6495034f8633bdc006f67"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":667,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/lZTmtSh4fdkFgMo8zXrAhuPnTrX.jpg","id":"4ea6495034f8633bdc006f67"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":800,"width":600,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/lZTmtSh4fdkFgMo8zXrAhuPnTrX.jpg","id":"4ea6495034f8633bdc006f67"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/4CAhxGtK28C61Dms7cL0ollw6NU.jpg","id":"4ea6495434f8633bdc006f6b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/4CAhxGtK28C61Dms7cL0ollw6NU.jpg","id":"4ea6495434f8633bdc006f6b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/4CAhxGtK28C61Dms7cL0ollw6NU.jpg","id":"4ea6495434f8633bdc006f6b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1125,"width":2000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/4CAhxGtK28C61Dms7cL0ollw6NU.jpg","id":"4ea6495434f8633bdc006f6b"}}],"version":294,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-21 15:22:14 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Choose Your Own Adventure - The Abominable Snowman","name":"Choose Your Own Adventure - The Abominable Snowman","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":67519,"imdb_id":"tt0460746","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/67519","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"This interactive movie follows three siblings (the North family) on a quest to rescue their Uncle in the Himalayan region of Nepal.

He left in December of that year. Three months later he arrived back agitated and paranoid. He said that while out on the ice he had stumbled onto a secret American nuclear site and the CIA had given him a chemical lobotomy to keep him quiet. Jimmy rapidly descended into schizophrenia. His behaviour became so frightening that his wife Frances fled to safety, taking their two children Sean and Juliet with her. For thirty years the family lived with this story, but no one ever dug deeper. The man they loved went away sane and came back permanently fractured – his mind was a blizzard.
