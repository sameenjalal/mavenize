The filmmaker behind the inquiry is Tom Shadyac, one of Hollywood’s leading comedy practitioners and the creative force behind such blockbusters as “Ace Ventura,” “Liar Liar,” “The Nutty Professor,” and “Bruce Almighty.”  However, in I AM, Shadyac steps in front of the camera to recount what happened to him after a cycling accident left him incapacitated, possibly for good. Though he ultimately recovered, he emerged with a new sense of purpose, determined to share his own awakening to his prior life of excess and greed, and to investigate how he as an individual, and we as a race, could improve the way we live and walk in the world.","released":"2011-02-11","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vQvzgJ4hKrCH874GHkvoJpEJMlw.jpg","id":"4f1fb8c719c29579c30017b9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vQvzgJ4hKrCH874GHkvoJpEJMlw.jpg","id":"4f1fb8c719c29579c30017b9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vQvzgJ4hKrCH874GHkvoJpEJMlw.jpg","id":"4f1fb8c719c29579c30017b9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vQvzgJ4hKrCH874GHkvoJpEJMlw.jpg","id":"4f1fb8c719c29579c30017b9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vQvzgJ4hKrCH874GHkvoJpEJMlw.jpg","id":"4f1fb8c719c29579c30017b9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1800,"width":1216,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vQvzgJ4hKrCH874GHkvoJpEJMlw.jpg","id":"4f1fb8c719c29579c30017b9"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":174,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/z7VGR0FZeaOGu9OcsgTmB2RnNKH.jpg","id":"4f1fbe2b760ee3624d0019f0"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":452,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/z7VGR0FZeaOGu9OcsgTmB2RnNKH.jpg","id":"4f1fbe2b760ee3624d0019f0"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":741,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/z7VGR0FZeaOGu9OcsgTmB2RnNKH.jpg","id":"4f1fbe2b760ee3624d0019f0"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":741,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/z7VGR0FZeaOGu9OcsgTmB2RnNKH.jpg","id":"4f1fbe2b760ee3624d0019f0"}}],"version":2,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 22:34:52 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"I Am","name":"I Am","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":41251,"imdb_id":"tt1497617","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/41251","votes":1,"rating":10.0,"certification":"PG","overview":"In the City of Angels, despair and heartache are the daily mail -- delivered with painful regularity whether we want them or not. Through I AM, we join an eclectic cast as they try to untangle themselves from the web of sin. All along the way, they are each joined by a mysterious companion -- ever present with a loving guidance without judgment for their actions. The more they attempt to fix their lives, the deeper they sink into chaos, pain, and loss. In addition, we discover that sin is a matrix connecting even the most remote of strangers to one another. It is at this breaking point when we see the presence of this companion was no accident. He was the ever-loving constant who refused to abandon His people -- even when they abandoned Him.","released":"2010-10-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/4AcqlZ58zW7LeapznskE42b0aEO.jpg","id":"4ea6844d9dc3d83c3b00a661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":218,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/4AcqlZ58zW7LeapznskE42b0aEO.jpg","id":"4ea6844d9dc3d83c3b00a661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":262,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/4AcqlZ58zW7LeapznskE42b0aEO.jpg","id":"4ea6844d9dc3d83c3b00a661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":484,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/4AcqlZ58zW7LeapznskE42b0aEO.jpg","id":"4ea6844d9dc3d83c3b00a661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":708,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/4AcqlZ58zW7LeapznskE42b0aEO.jpg","id":"4ea6844d9dc3d83c3b00a661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":991,"width":700,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/4AcqlZ58zW7LeapznskE42b0aEO.jpg","id":"4ea6844d9dc3d83c3b00a661"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1134,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 07:33:44 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"I Am","name":"I Am","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":63467,"imdb_id":"tt1629295","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/63467","votes":1,"rating":7.0,"certification":null,"overview":"The story is divided into 4 short stories about issues and dilemmas that bruises the modern Indian society, It unfolds tales of individuals struggling to find their identity, and uphold their dignity in a world that is cold and unsympathetic.","released":"2011-04-29","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/wdgL2w9QD4lURuQ36L6sSV1kBFf.jpg","id":"4ea699a52c058837cb00e7d1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":219,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/wdgL2w9QD4lURuQ36L6sSV1kBFf.jpg","id":"4ea699a52c058837cb00e7d1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":263,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wdgL2w9QD4lURuQ36L6sSV1kBFf.jpg","id":"4ea699a52c058837cb00e7d1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":487,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/wdgL2w9QD4lURuQ36L6sSV1kBFf.jpg","id":"4ea699a52c058837cb00e7d1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":712,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/wdgL2w9QD4lURuQ36L6sSV1kBFf.jpg","id":"4ea699a52c058837cb00e7d1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":712,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/wdgL2w9QD4lURuQ36L6sSV1kBFf.jpg","id":"4ea699a52c058837cb00e7d1"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":876,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 14:01:39 UTC"}]
