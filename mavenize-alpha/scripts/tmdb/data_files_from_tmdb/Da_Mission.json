William McNamara is imprisoned in a brutal German POW camp. Still, as the senior-ranking American officer, he commands his fellow inmates, keeping a sense of honor alive in a place where honor is easy to destroy, all under the dangerous eye of the Luftwafe vetran Col. Wilhelm Visser. Never giving up the fight to win the war, McNamara is silently planning, waiting for his moment to strike back at the enemy.

Now he lives with his rich wife in her castle - and is bored almost to death. He fights with the butler, because he isn't even allowed to do the simple works. But when one of the clique suffers from amnesia after an accident, all of the others reunite and kidnap him, to take him on a tour to their old working places and through their memories. In their old uniforms they turn St. Tropez upside down.","released":"1970-10-28","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/775WIclpPf8naRLGfKnBe3vM6Kv.jpg","id":"4ea6529ba34d4b4a4f000d2f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/775WIclpPf8naRLGfKnBe3vM6Kv.jpg","id":"4ea6529ba34d4b4a4f000d2f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/775WIclpPf8naRLGfKnBe3vM6Kv.jpg","id":"4ea6529ba34d4b4a4f000d2f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/775WIclpPf8naRLGfKnBe3vM6Kv.jpg","id":"4ea6529ba34d4b4a4f000d2f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":705,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/775WIclpPf8naRLGfKnBe3vM6Kv.jpg","id":"4ea6529ba34d4b4a4f000d2f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1436,"width":1018,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/775WIclpPf8naRLGfKnBe3vM6Kv.jpg","id":"4ea6529ba34d4b4a4f000d2f"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/zRAZ8gXxnTwgL5XHBEYZdK48Lho.jpg","id":"4ea652a4a34d4b4a4f000d37"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/zRAZ8gXxnTwgL5XHBEYZdK48Lho.jpg","id":"4ea652a4a34d4b4a4f000d37"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/zRAZ8gXxnTwgL5XHBEYZdK48Lho.jpg","id":"4ea652a4a34d4b4a4f000d37"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/zRAZ8gXxnTwgL5XHBEYZdK48Lho.jpg","id":"4ea652a4a34d4b4a4f000d37"}}],"version":110,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 19:09:16 UTC"},{"score":0.40672365,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Quel maledetto treno blindato","name":"The Inglorious Bastards","alternative_name":"G.I.

This film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and was released theatrically nationwide on February 16, 2001.It's the most exciting time of year at Third Street Elementary-- the end of the School Year! But boredom quickly sets in for protagonist TJ Detweiler, as his friends are headed for Summer Camp. One day, while passing by the school on his bike, he notices a green glow coming from the school's auditorium. This is the work of the insidious ex-principal of Third Street, Phillium Benedict and his gang of ninjas and secret service look-alikes! Benedict is planning to get rid of Summer Vacation using his newly-acquired Tractor Beam, which he stole from the US Military Base in an effort to raise US Test Scores, and it's up to the Recess Gang to stop him!
