In addition to his penchant for much younger women, Chaplin was unjustly hounded by Senator Joe McCarthy's notorious anti-Communist witch hunts, for which the U.S. revoked his visa in 1952. A bitter and disenchanted Chaplin responded by moving his family to Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1977. This documentary chronicles Chaplin's life and career during those so-called \"forgotten years\" (during which he became a prolific and highly respected film-score composer) through previously unreleased archival footage and intimate interviews with his friends and family, including his children Geraldine, Michael, and Eugene.","released":"2003-05-18","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":124,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg","id":"4ea71be634f863633c0049cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":208,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg","id":"4ea71be634f863633c0049cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":250,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg","id":"4ea71be634f863633c0049cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":462,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg","id":"4ea71be634f863633c0049cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":676,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg","id":"4ea71be634f863633c0049cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":900,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mubJWHL3GlLSnKCxZaDpF1yY3Q5.jpg","id":"4ea71be634f863633c0049cd"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":356,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 09:27:13 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Charlie Chaplin - The Tramp Forever","name":"Charlie Chaplin - The Tramp Forever","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":64941,"imdb_id":null,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/64941","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"6 classic episodes: 1.
