With one of the most advanced medical systems in the world and alternative health modalities at our disposal, is it possible to be healthy at a variety of sizes and weights?","released":"2011-10-12","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":133,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/NTruPjzFGxc138U2OWKfIaMNX5.jpg","id":"4ea6aa632c058837cb010337"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":222,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/NTruPjzFGxc138U2OWKfIaMNX5.jpg","id":"4ea6aa632c058837cb010337"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":267,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/NTruPjzFGxc138U2OWKfIaMNX5.jpg","id":"4ea6aa632c058837cb010337"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":494,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/NTruPjzFGxc138U2OWKfIaMNX5.jpg","id":"4ea6aa632c058837cb010337"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":722,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/NTruPjzFGxc138U2OWKfIaMNX5.jpg","id":"4ea6aa632c058837cb010337"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":650,"width":450,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/NTruPjzFGxc138U2OWKfIaMNX5.jpg","id":"4ea6aa632c058837cb010337"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":2,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 17:51:37 UTC"},{"score":1.0509958,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Beautiful Dreamer","name":"Beautiful Dreamer","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":18531,"imdb_id":"tt0440961","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/18531","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"A pilot (Egglesfield) gets shot down and gets amnesia, later on his stricken-with-grief wife (Langton) finds him in a small town and his shocked that he doesn't remember her.","released":"2006-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/tlhEo9RpG1lHl0Oi3UUsfg8o69y.jpg","id":"4ea63fbf9dc3d83c3b00602d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/tlhEo9RpG1lHl0Oi3UUsfg8o69y.jpg","id":"4ea63fbf9dc3d83c3b00602d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/tlhEo9RpG1lHl0Oi3UUsfg8o69y.jpg","id":"4ea63fbf9dc3d83c3b00602d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/tlhEo9RpG1lHl0Oi3UUsfg8o69y.jpg","id":"4ea63fbf9dc3d83c3b00602d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/tlhEo9RpG1lHl0Oi3UUsfg8o69y.jpg","id":"4ea63fbf9dc3d83c3b00602d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1480,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/tlhEo9RpG1lHl0Oi3UUsfg8o69y.jpg","id":"4ea63fbf9dc3d83c3b00602d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/kjTkYVAOlADJqpZW8xGYprbmxC5.jpg","id":"4ea63fbd9dc3d83c3b00602b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/kjTkYVAOlADJqpZW8xGYprbmxC5.jpg","id":"4ea63fbd9dc3d83c3b00602b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/kjTkYVAOlADJqpZW8xGYprbmxC5.jpg","id":"4ea63fbd9dc3d83c3b00602b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/kjTkYVAOlADJqpZW8xGYprbmxC5.jpg","id":"4ea63fbd9dc3d83c3b00602b"}}],"version":167,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 20:54:42 UTC"},{"score":0.69288397,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of Smile","name":"Beautiful Dreamer: Brian Wilson and the Story of Smile","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":59100,"imdb_id":"tt0421696","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/59100","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"This film tells (using modern day interviews and archival footage and sound tapes) the story of how in 1967, while his band The Beach Boys triumphantly toured abroad, Brian Wilson was trying to push the boundaries of conventional pop music with a new follow-up to the Beach Boys' cutting-edge mega-hit, Pet Sounds. The new album was to be called \"SMiLE\". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light.","released":"2004-10-05","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/iFNub6ktfbVF6pD0epqzODK5ANG.jpg","id":"4f1e2a30760ee343240002bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/iFNub6ktfbVF6pD0epqzODK5ANG.jpg","id":"4f1e2a30760ee343240002bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/iFNub6ktfbVF6pD0epqzODK5ANG.jpg","id":"4f1e2a30760ee343240002bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":479,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/iFNub6ktfbVF6pD0epqzODK5ANG.jpg","id":"4f1e2a30760ee343240002bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":701,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/iFNub6ktfbVF6pD0epqzODK5ANG.jpg","id":"4f1e2a30760ee343240002bf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2238,"width":1597,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/iFNub6ktfbVF6pD0epqzODK5ANG.jpg","id":"4f1e2a30760ee343240002bf"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/1z2MQSOkAQVAsK2Cn4UqBgDO9yb.jpg","id":"4f1e2ac3760ee343210002f7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/1z2MQSOkAQVAsK2Cn4UqBgDO9yb.jpg","id":"4f1e2ac3760ee343210002f7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/1z2MQSOkAQVAsK2Cn4UqBgDO9yb.jpg","id":"4f1e2ac3760ee343210002f7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1z2MQSOkAQVAsK2Cn4UqBgDO9yb.jpg","id":"4f1e2ac3760ee343210002f7"}}],"version":74,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 09:17:17 UTC"},{"score":0.7177222,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Beautician and the Beast","name":"The Beautician and the Beast","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":17894,"imdb_id":"tt0118691","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/17894","votes":1,"rating":6.0,"certification":"PG","overview":"The story follows the misadventures of a New York City beautician who is mistakenly hired as the school teacher for the children of the president of a small Eastern European country.","released":"1997-02-07","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":140,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/sF8WfAGm2z8GWwgGbPAZj3vq0w6.jpg","id":"4ea63c694f13c137cc0063a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":234,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/sF8WfAGm2z8GWwgGbPAZj3vq0w6.jpg","id":"4ea63c694f13c137cc0063a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":281,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/sF8WfAGm2z8GWwgGbPAZj3vq0w6.jpg","id":"4ea63c694f13c137cc0063a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":520,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/sF8WfAGm2z8GWwgGbPAZj3vq0w6.jpg","id":"4ea63c694f13c137cc0063a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":760,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/sF8WfAGm2z8GWwgGbPAZj3vq0w6.jpg","id":"4ea63c694f13c137cc0063a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1012,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/sF8WfAGm2z8GWwgGbPAZj3vq0w6.jpg","id":"4ea63c694f13c137cc0063a7"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/18jHTCv3NKYnfQFHIHFu75tQwcZ.jpg","id":"4ea63c664f13c137cc0063a5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/18jHTCv3NKYnfQFHIHFu75tQwcZ.jpg","id":"4ea63c664f13c137cc0063a5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/18jHTCv3NKYnfQFHIHFu75tQwcZ.jpg","id":"4ea63c664f13c137cc0063a5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/18jHTCv3NKYnfQFHIHFu75tQwcZ.jpg","id":"4ea63c664f13c137cc0063a5"}}],"version":350,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 09:55:33 UTC"},{"score":0.6602405,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Urusei Yatsura 2: Byûtifuru dorîmâ","name":"Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer","alternative_name":"Urusei Yatsura Movie 2: Beautiful Dreamer","movie_type":"movie","id":43967,"imdb_id":"tt0088334","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/43967","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":null,"overview":"As the perpetually lecherous Ataru and his friends prepare for a carnival at Tomobiki High School, they gradually realize the days are literally repeating themselves.
