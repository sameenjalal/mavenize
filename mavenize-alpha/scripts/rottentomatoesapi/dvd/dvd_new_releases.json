Faced with the proposition that his disturbing visions signal disaster of one kind or another, Curtis confides in Samantha, testing the power of their bond against the highest possible stakes. -- (C) Sony Classics","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/89/11158902_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/89/11158902_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/89/11158902_det.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/89/11158902_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael Shannon","characters":["Curtis","Curtis LaForche"]},{"name":"Jessica Chastain","characters":["Samantha"]},{"name":"Tova Stewart","characters":["Hannah"]},{"name":"Shea Whigham","characters":["Dewart"]},{"name":"Natasha Randall","characters":["Cammie"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1675192"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/take_shelter/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/similar.json"}},{"id":"771205845","title":"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)","year":2011,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":88,"critics_consensus":"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) attempts to weave in social commentary but as the movie wears on, it loses its ability to repulse and shock and ends up obnoxious and annoying.","release_dates":{"theater":"2011-10-07","dvd":"2012-02-14"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":30,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":29},"synopsis":"Tom Six's internationally controversial follow-up to the original cult smash, The Human Centipede: Full Sequence ups the ante with a brute force unparalleled in motion pictures today. -- (C) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160659_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160659_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160659_det.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160659_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ashlynn Yennie","characters":["Ashlynn Yennie","Miss Yennie"]},{"name":"Laurence R.
