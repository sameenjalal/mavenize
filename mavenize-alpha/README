django_project
==============

This is my 'generic Django project' that I use for all of my Django sites. I
was inspired to make this by https://github.com/fiee/generic_django_project (if
you're reading this, thanks!).

The main idea of this project is to provide a sturdy base Django site that can
help you rapidly build / deploy Django projects.

The current version of this project supports:

	- Django 1.3
	- django-celery 2.2.4
	- Fabric 1.0.1
	- South 0.7.3
	- django-debug-toolbar 0.8.4
	- gunicorn 0.12.1
	- django-sentry 1.6.6.1
	- python-memcached 1.47
	- django-kombu 0.9.2

To get started, you can clone this project, eg:

	git clone git://github.com/rdegges/django_project.git

And make the necessary changes to your settings/common.py, settings/dev.py,
settings/stag.py, and settings/prod.py configuration files. To run the project
in development mode, just do:

	python manage.py runserver --settings=settings.dev

And you should be good to go.

I'm planning on adding more documentation / features / tools as I go along, so
please let me know if there's anything you'd like to see added / fixed /
removed.
