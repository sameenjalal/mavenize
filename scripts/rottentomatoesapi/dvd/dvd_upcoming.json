In this divinely bizarre and funny tale, wild characters infuse stories within stories until the lines between the Bible, Mark Twain, and campfire tales are hilariously blurred. Father Billy (Steve Little), an eccentric young priest, is forced to take asabbatical by his superiors when he is discovered telling inappropriate parables to his flock. Billy tracks down his high-school idol Robbie (Robert Longstreet), who begrudgingly agrees to a canoe trip. On the water, the two men reminisce about Billy's days as the keyboardist in a Christian band and Robbie's as a guitarist for a metal band. When night approaches, they realize they have lost their way--and that's when things get weird. -- (C) IFC Midnight","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/07/11160705_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/07/11160705_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/07/11160705_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/07/11160705_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Steven E.

Concerned of the consequences should his fellow crime fighters ever turn their backs on humanity, Batman compiles a list detailing the methods he will need to defeat Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, and Cyborg in the event of an emergency. But when Vandal Savage breaches the Batcave's security and gets his hands on the list, the Justice League must overcome deep feelings of betrayal to defeat the diabolical Legion of Doom. Meanwhile, The Dark Knight struggles to make a decision that could have devastating consequences. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/36/11163647_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/36/11163647_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/36/11163647_det.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/36/11163647_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Nathan Fillion","characters":["Green Lantern"]},{"name":"Tim Daly","characters":["Superman"]},{"name":"Kevin Conroy","characters":["Batman"]},{"name":"Susan Eisenberg","characters":["Wonder Woman"]},{"name":"Carl Lumbly","characters":["Martian Manhunter"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265713.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/justice_league_doom/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265713/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265713/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265713/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265713/similar.json"}},{"id":"731001889","title":"The Sky Turns","year":2011,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":115,"release_dates":{"theater":"2011-02-11","dvd":"2012-02-28"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":100,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":77},"synopsis":"Mercedes Alvarez was three years old when, in the late 1960s, her parents left La Aldea, a village in the barren Northern Spanish Soria region. She was the last child born in La Aldea. Now, only fourteen people live there, a last dying generation. Soon this village, like so many other rural communities all over the world, will be deserted and will probably disappear from the map.

Tali (Liat Har Lev) has become trapped in a stretch of mine shaft that hasn't been used in years, and her brother Ofer (David Henry) is desperate to free her, in part for the sake of her safety and partly in fear of their parents learning their shocking secret. Tennis players Adi (Ania Bukstein) and Shir (Yael Grobglas) are en route to a match with Mike (Ran Danker) and Pini (Ofer Shechter) when a short cut goes wrong and they end up lost. Menashe (Menashe Noy) is a forest ranger who senses things are not quite right while talking his dog for a walk. And Dani (Lior Ashkenazi) and Yuval (Danny Geva) are a pair of clumsy police officers patrolling the area. Ofer flags down the tennis players for help, and before long the cops and the forest ranger show up. As this group of strangers try to deal with the immediate crisis, they soon discover a serial killer is on the loose, and deadly violence is appearing in unexpected places. Billed as the first Israeli slasher film, Kalevet (aka Rabies) received its North American premiere at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, where it screened as part of the Cinemania program. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","profile":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","detailed":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","original":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Lior Ashkenazi"},{"name":"Ania Bukstein"},{"name":"Danny Geva"},{"name":"Yael Grobglas"},{"name":"Ran Danker"}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771239320.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rabies/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771239320/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771239320/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771239320/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771239320/similar.json"}},{"id":"770817170","title":"Mandrill","year":2009,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":93,"release_dates":{"theater":"2009-09-15","dvd":"2012-02-28"},"ratings":{"critics_score":-1,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":58},"synopsis":"","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/12/10921296_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/12/10921296_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/12/10921296_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/92/12/10921296_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Marko Zaror"},{"name":"Celine Reymond"},{"name":"Alejandro Castillo"},{"name":"Luis Alarcon"},{"name":"Maria Jose Prieto"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1434618"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817170.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mandrill/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817170/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817170/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817170/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817170/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/upcoming.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=1","next":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/upcoming.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=2","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/dvd/upcoming.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/upcoming.json?page_limit={results-per-page}&page={page-number}&country={country-code}"}
