Strangely, every time she steals something, a mysterious man pays for it. A clumsy detective begins investigating and finds a crucial clue: a strongly scented woman's glove. The perfume is an expensive scent and the detective's pal realizes that it belongs to a popular nightclub singer. The friend quickly becomes enamored of the girl, but then so does her mystery man, a notorious international criminal. Eventually he gets arrested, leaving the detective's pal to move in on the singer.","keywords":["juwelenhändler","parfum","police","trickbetrug","kavaliere","brillanten"],"released":"1933-01-01","runtime":81,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/mystery","name":"Mystery","id":9648},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35}],"studios":[{"name":"Super-Film GmbH","id":2156,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/2156-super-film-gmbh"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"de","name":"German","native_name":"Deutsch"}],"countries":[{"code":"DE","name":"Germany","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/de"}],"posters":[],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Géza von Bolváry","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":51590,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51590","profile":""},{"name":"Franz Schulz","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":13885,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/13885","profile":""},{"name":"Billy Wilder","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":3146,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3146","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1hDAFo3qEIS6QRDQhZR9WljSLTU.jpg"},{"name":"Julius Haimann","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":51598,"order":0,"cast_id":16,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51598","profile":""},{"name":"Robert Stolz","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":33173,"order":0,"cast_id":17,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/33173","profile":""},{"name":"Willy Goldberger","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":28123,"order":0,"cast_id":18,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/28123","profile":""},{"name":"Käthe Kopitzke","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":51599,"order":0,"cast_id":19,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51599","profile":""},{"name":"Nora Gregor","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Rina Korff","id":11534,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/11534","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/t2Kyf3S2nPURUWi9gsTyTO7EvwG.jpg"},{"name":"Gustav Fröhlich","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Walter König","id":74,"order":1,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/74","profile":""},{"name":"Otto Wallburg","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Kleinsilber","id":51591,"order":2,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51591","profile":""},{"name":"Peter Lorre","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Otto Fuessli","id":2094,"order":3,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/2094","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/yrQcTNmGWNVp871D9fbjNpN6LpV.jpg"},{"name":"Kurt Horwitz","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Levassor alias John Constantinescu","id":51592,"order":4,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51592","profile":""},{"name":"Lya Christy","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":51593,"order":5,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51593","profile":""},{"name":"Erik Ode","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":47214,"order":6,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47214","profile":""},{"name":"Carl Auen","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":51594,"order":7,"cast_id":11,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51594","profile":""},{"name":"Eric Steinbeck","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":51595,"order":8,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51595","profile":""},{"name":"Kurt Lilien","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":28129,"order":9,"cast_id":13,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/28129","profile":""},{"name":"Hilde Maroff","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":51596,"order":10,"cast_id":14,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51596","profile":""},{"name":"Eric Helgar","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"-","id":51597,"order":11,"cast_id":15,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51597","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":63,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 17:46:37 UTC"}]
