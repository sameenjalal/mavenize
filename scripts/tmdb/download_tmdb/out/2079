His superior discovers a note explaining the count can't attend a party, and dresses up like one to take his place. Chaplin also goes to the residence hosting the party, but runs into the tailor. They both then struggle to win the fair maiden, Miss Moneybags. Soon, Charlie is distracted by a gypsy girl and the tailor must fend off other suitors. The real Count finally arrives, learns of the imposters and calls the police.","keywords":["mistake in person","dressmaker"],"released":"1916-09-04","runtime":34,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/short","name":"Short","id":10755}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":142,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/6SWl47HgOico4G2aEUYrGuhBf3C.jpg","id":"4f76281c19c295447300094c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":238,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/6SWl47HgOico4G2aEUYrGuhBf3C.jpg","id":"4f76281c19c295447300094c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":286,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/6SWl47HgOico4G2aEUYrGuhBf3C.jpg","id":"4f76281c19c295447300094c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":528,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6SWl47HgOico4G2aEUYrGuhBf3C.jpg","id":"4f76281c19c295447300094c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":773,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/6SWl47HgOico4G2aEUYrGuhBf3C.jpg","id":"4f76281c19c295447300094c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1545,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6SWl47HgOico4G2aEUYrGuhBf3C.jpg","id":"4f76281c19c295447300094c"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":124,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1T8dAT5UpKMhwR9rMJctlcjeSnM.jpg","id":"4ea5ebb84f13c137cc001969"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":207,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1T8dAT5UpKMhwR9rMJctlcjeSnM.jpg","id":"4ea5ebb84f13c137cc001969"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":249,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1T8dAT5UpKMhwR9rMJctlcjeSnM.jpg","id":"4ea5ebb84f13c137cc001969"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":460,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1T8dAT5UpKMhwR9rMJctlcjeSnM.jpg","id":"4ea5ebb84f13c137cc001969"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":672,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1T8dAT5UpKMhwR9rMJctlcjeSnM.jpg","id":"4ea5ebb84f13c137cc001969"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":895,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1T8dAT5UpKMhwR9rMJctlcjeSnM.jpg","id":"4ea5ebb84f13c137cc001969"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Charlie Chaplin","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":13848,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/13848","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wJIJjGii870kq9fEdg9xfwkoVu.jpg"},{"name":"Charlie Chaplin","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":13848,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/13848","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wJIJjGii870kq9fEdg9xfwkoVu.jpg"},{"name":"Charlie Chaplin","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":13848,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/13848","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wJIJjGii870kq9fEdg9xfwkoVu.jpg"},{"name":"Henry P.
