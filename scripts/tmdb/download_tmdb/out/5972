Returning to the practise of his lawyer skills, he takes the case of Leonard Vole, an unemployed man who is accused of murdering an elderly lady friend of his, Mrs. Emily French. While Leonard Vole claims he's innocent, although all evidence points to him as the killer, his alibi witness, his cold German wife Christine, instead of entering the court as a witness for the defense, she becomes the witness for the prosecution and strongly claims her husband is guilty of the murder.","keywords":["court"],"released":"1982-12-04","runtime":97,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/thriller","name":"Thriller","id":53},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/mystery","name":"Mystery","id":9648}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/gb"},{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":151,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/mvPshdkmdYKKp6si5pOUmYMCAz9.jpg","id":"4ea5f7b82c058837cb002575"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":253,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/mvPshdkmdYKKp6si5pOUmYMCAz9.jpg","id":"4ea5f7b82c058837cb002575"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":304,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/mvPshdkmdYKKp6si5pOUmYMCAz9.jpg","id":"4ea5f7b82c058837cb002575"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":563,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/mvPshdkmdYKKp6si5pOUmYMCAz9.jpg","id":"4ea5f7b82c058837cb002575"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":823,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/mvPshdkmdYKKp6si5pOUmYMCAz9.jpg","id":"4ea5f7b82c058837cb002575"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1086,"width":660,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mvPshdkmdYKKp6si5pOUmYMCAz9.jpg","id":"4ea5f7b82c058837cb002575"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/1so54Rj3q3hVncYsWktk3eDgOMj.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bb2c058837cb002577"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/1so54Rj3q3hVncYsWktk3eDgOMj.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bb2c058837cb002577"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/1so54Rj3q3hVncYsWktk3eDgOMj.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bb2c058837cb002577"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1so54Rj3q3hVncYsWktk3eDgOMj.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bb2c058837cb002577"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/plbww96adQTeCBSC6PYXekoO0QI.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bd2c058837cb002579"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/plbww96adQTeCBSC6PYXekoO0QI.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bd2c058837cb002579"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/plbww96adQTeCBSC6PYXekoO0QI.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bd2c058837cb002579"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/plbww96adQTeCBSC6PYXekoO0QI.jpg","id":"4ea5f7bd2c058837cb002579"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Alan Gibson","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":46997,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/46997","profile":""},{"name":"Agatha Christie","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":47562,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47562","profile":""},{"name":"Billy Wilder","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":3146,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3146","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1hDAFo3qEIS6QRDQhZR9WljSLTU.jpg"},{"name":"Harry Kurnitz","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":17843,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/17843","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/AavMMtPOF9e6qjktWazo9gJzSSq.jpg"},{"name":"Lawrence B.
