Theirs appears to be the perfect marriage, but while on holiday in Italy Evelyne falls in love with a young Frenchman, Rémy. While Evelyne is profoundly unsettled by this romantic entanglement, Rémy regards it as a mere distraction and soon heads back to Paris where he lives with his mistress, Marion. One day, Evelyne is overjoyed when she receives an invitation from Rémy to spend a weekend with him in Paris. The morning after their first night together in Rémy’s apartment, Evelyne accidentally breaks a glass ornament in the shape of a castle. The incident proves to be an omen of bad luck.","keywords":["adultery","1930er"],"released":"1950-12-16","runtime":99,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":124,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1VmXQO2AUGPStQPK0iaqjzLquWE.jpg","id":"4ea5eeec34f8633bdc00230f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":207,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1VmXQO2AUGPStQPK0iaqjzLquWE.jpg","id":"4ea5eeec34f8633bdc00230f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":249,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1VmXQO2AUGPStQPK0iaqjzLquWE.jpg","id":"4ea5eeec34f8633bdc00230f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":461,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1VmXQO2AUGPStQPK0iaqjzLquWE.jpg","id":"4ea5eeec34f8633bdc00230f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":674,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1VmXQO2AUGPStQPK0iaqjzLquWE.jpg","id":"4ea5eeec34f8633bdc00230f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1668,"width":1238,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1VmXQO2AUGPStQPK0iaqjzLquWE.jpg","id":"4ea5eeec34f8633bdc00230f"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"René Clément","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":9740,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/9740","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wpONpK02rW5clKZzFKjA7NAmv2H.jpg"},{"name":"Vicki Baum","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":27899,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27899","profile":""},{"name":"Robert Lefebvre","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":45479,"order":0,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/45479","profile":""},{"name":"Vicki Baum","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":27899,"order":0,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27899","profile":""},{"name":"Gian Bistolfi","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":47109,"order":0,"cast_id":11,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47109","profile":""},{"name":"Henry Deutschmeister","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":47110,"order":0,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47110","profile":""},{"name":"Yves Baudrier","job":"Music","department":"Sound","character":"","id":47111,"order":0,"cast_id":14,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47111","profile":""},{"name":"Roger Dwyre","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":14235,"order":0,"cast_id":15,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/14235","profile":""},{"name":"Michèle Morgan","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Evelyne Bartal","id":35254,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35254","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/5iHEOrPh9XLLwvv8t0w7uepC4Q5.jpg"},{"name":"Jean Marais","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Rémy Marsay","id":9741,"order":1,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/9741","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/5WL9XjylWBSpwZua0ZDHc1OxMof.jpg"},{"name":"Jean Servais","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Laurent Bartel","id":14242,"order":2,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/14242","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/tKzre5yY1u3nrhecp4QlgyyJ0uT.jpg"},{"name":"Elisa Cegani","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Eléna","id":33636,"order":3,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/33636","profile":""},{"name":"Elina Labourdette","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Marion","id":45477,"order":4,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/45477","profile":""},{"name":"Germaine Stainval","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"la bonne","id":45478,"order":5,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/45478","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":70,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-07 16:34:56 UTC"}]
