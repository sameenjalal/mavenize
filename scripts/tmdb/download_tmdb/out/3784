The film is okay and not much more than that, the major stumbling block being Marshall's failure to scrub away enough star veneer on Pacino and Pfeiffer to accept them as minimum-wage drones with nowhere to go but toward each other. Fortunately, Marshall's feel for the texture offered by supporting players--Hector Elizondo as a caf√© owner, Nathan Lane as Pfeiffer's inevitably gay neighbour-buddy, Kate Nelligan as another lonely waitress--keeps things interesting enough.","keywords":["waitress","ex-detainee","cook","cowardliness ","based on
