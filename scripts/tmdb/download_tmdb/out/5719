Calif, a stranger with a past walks into Spooner, Missouri on his way from Michigan to California. He hires on with Lute Wade to earn some travelling money, but gets entangled in a bad family situation: Lute's daughter is married to Sidney, a good-for-nothing drunk that frequents the rural equivalent of a whorehouse and beats his wife and is just waiting for Lute to kick the bucket to get his money. When Sidney and a local wacko preacher begin orchestrating a smear campaign against Calif, he finds it difficult to conceal his past and his growing affection for Sidney's wife.","keywords":["female nudity"],"released":"1965-05-25","runtime":92,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/erotic","name":"Erotic","id":2916}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":127,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/lsC4WazA5f4BVmABxjP7NGThcak.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b14f13c137cc00243d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":212,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/lsC4WazA5f4BVmABxjP7NGThcak.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b14f13c137cc00243d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":255,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/lsC4WazA5f4BVmABxjP7NGThcak.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b14f13c137cc00243d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":471,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/lsC4WazA5f4BVmABxjP7NGThcak.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b14f13c137cc00243d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":688,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/lsC4WazA5f4BVmABxjP7NGThcak.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b14f13c137cc00243d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2448,"width":1779,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/lsC4WazA5f4BVmABxjP7NGThcak.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b14f13c137cc00243d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":135,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1vxuHGt10Sx5jOLN2PSeuFkQfo1.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b44f13c137cc00243f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":227,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1vxuHGt10Sx5jOLN2PSeuFkQfo1.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b44f13c137cc00243f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":272,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1vxuHGt10Sx5jOLN2PSeuFkQfo1.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b44f13c137cc00243f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":503,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1vxuHGt10Sx5jOLN2PSeuFkQfo1.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b44f13c137cc00243f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":736,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1vxuHGt10Sx5jOLN2PSeuFkQfo1.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b44f13c137cc00243f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2030,"width":1380,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1vxuHGt10Sx5jOLN2PSeuFkQfo1.jpg","id":"4ea5f9b44f13c137cc00243f"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Walter Schenk","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":4684,"order":0,"cast_id":24,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/4684","profile":""},{"name":"George Costello","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":45090,"order":0,"cast_id":23,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/45090","profile":""},{"name":"Andr√© Brummer","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":45079,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/45079","profile":""},{"name":"Russ Meyer","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":4590,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/4590","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/4w6izR5bsjPNTQufl69K7qodcIb.jpg"},{"name":"W.E.
