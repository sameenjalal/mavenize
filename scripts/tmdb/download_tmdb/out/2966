Nautilus.","keywords":[],"released":"1997-05-11","runtime":158,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/adventure","name":"Adventure","id":12},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/fantasy","name":"Fantasy","id":14},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/science-fiction","name":"Science
