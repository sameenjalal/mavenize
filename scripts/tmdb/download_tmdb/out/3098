He was born in 1911 in Newport, South Wales and presumably last heard of in 1989. His life is reconstructed from the evidence of 92 suitcases found around the world - 92 being the atomic number of the element Uranium. The project includes three feature films, a TV series, 92 DVDs, CD-ROMs, and books.","keywords":[],"released":"2004-02-09","runtime":108,"budget":10000000,"revenue":24250,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/history","name":"History","id":36}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/gb"},{"code":"NL","name":"Netherlands","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/nl"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/y0dvg2ejtd8CYoEzxBtWh9W7X8x.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ba34d4b41fd0001a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":219,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/y0dvg2ejtd8CYoEzxBtWh9W7X8x.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ba34d4b41fd0001a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":263,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/y0dvg2ejtd8CYoEzxBtWh9W7X8x.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ba34d4b41fd0001a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":487,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/y0dvg2ejtd8CYoEzxBtWh9W7X8x.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ba34d4b41fd0001a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":712,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/y0dvg2ejtd8CYoEzxBtWh9W7X8x.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ba34d4b41fd0001a7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":948,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/y0dvg2ejtd8CYoEzxBtWh9W7X8x.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ba34d4b41fd0001a7"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/xaysWwvX2Y1yIqbVaJDnVUI8Fqs.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ea34d4b41fd0001a9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/xaysWwvX2Y1yIqbVaJDnVUI8Fqs.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ea34d4b41fd0001a9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/xaysWwvX2Y1yIqbVaJDnVUI8Fqs.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ea34d4b41fd0001a9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/xaysWwvX2Y1yIqbVaJDnVUI8Fqs.jpg","id":"4ea60b3ea34d4b41fd0001a9"}}],"cast":[{"name":"JJ Feild","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Tulse Luper","id":30710,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/30710","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/gCmitg6u4VNQ6saPj5E1kA64NZC.jpg"},{"name":"Raymond J.
