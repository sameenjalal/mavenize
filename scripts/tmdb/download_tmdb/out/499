As Cléo readies herself to meet with her doctor at 7 o'clock, she meets with several friends and strangers while trying to grapple with mortality. Sensing indifference from those nearest to her, she finds herself questioning the doll-like image people have of her and is overcome by a feeling of solitude and helplessness. She finally finds some comfort in the company of stranger she meets in a park and with whom she is able to have a sincere conversation.","keywords":["individual","paris","krebs","algerienkrieg","sängerin"],"released":"1962-04-11","runtime":90,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjskdSjzhw","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/music","name":"Music","id":10402},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/foreign","name":"Foreign","id":10769}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"},{"code":"IT","name":"Italy","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/it"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/boSXPwQgmbuKm3CmVYf53IIdqmi.jpg","id":"4ea5d65e4f13c137cc000889"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":219,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/boSXPwQgmbuKm3CmVYf53IIdqmi.jpg","id":"4ea5d65e4f13c137cc000889"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":263,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/boSXPwQgmbuKm3CmVYf53IIdqmi.jpg","id":"4ea5d65e4f13c137cc000889"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":486,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/boSXPwQgmbuKm3CmVYf53IIdqmi.jpg","id":"4ea5d65e4f13c137cc000889"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":711,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/boSXPwQgmbuKm3CmVYf53IIdqmi.jpg","id":"4ea5d65e4f13c137cc000889"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1447,"width":1018,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/boSXPwQgmbuKm3CmVYf53IIdqmi.jpg","id":"4ea5d65e4f13c137cc000889"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":188,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/kggWFrr7Gzkno4dmArJZcG17v2x.jpg","id":"4ea5d6614f13c137cc00088b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":488,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/kggWFrr7Gzkno4dmArJZcG17v2x.jpg","id":"4ea5d6614f13c137cc00088b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":800,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/kggWFrr7Gzkno4dmArJZcG17v2x.jpg","id":"4ea5d6614f13c137cc00088b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":800,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/kggWFrr7Gzkno4dmArJZcG17v2x.jpg","id":"4ea5d6614f13c137cc00088b"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Agnès Varda","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":6817,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/6817","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/tNFk0ma0TdBq00XYhSiV3Pbec7R.jpg"},{"name":"Agnès Varda","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":6817,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/6817","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/tNFk0ma0TdBq00XYhSiV3Pbec7R.jpg"},{"name":"Agnès Varda","job":"Author","department":"Writing","character":"","id":6817,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/6817","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/tNFk0ma0TdBq00XYhSiV3Pbec7R.jpg"},{"name":"Corinne Marchand","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Cléo Victoire, Florence","id":7565,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/7565","profile":""},{"name":"Antoine Bourseiller","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Antoine","id":7566,"order":1,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/7566","profile":""},{"name":"Dominique Davray","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Angèle","id":7568,"order":2,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/7568","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":117,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-15 01:25:51 UTC"}]
