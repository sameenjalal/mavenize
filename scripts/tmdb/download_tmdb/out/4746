Julien is from Luxemburg, so instead of having to go to war he studies piano in Paris. One day his friend Jacques, also a musician and now a fighter pilot on the front, invites him to spend a few days in his family's empty house in Bray. The housekeeper, a beautiful but mute woman lets Julien in, but his friend is late and he is obliged to wait. In the meantime, he starts reminiscing of the pre-war days spent with his friend and Jacques' girlfriend Odile.","keywords":["servant","ww i","friendship"],"released":"1971-06-12","runtime":90,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/music","name":"Music","id":10402},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/war","name":"War","id":10752}],"studios":[{"name":"Studios Arthur Mathonet","id":1745,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/1745-studios-arthur-mathonet"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"BE","name":"Belgium","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/be"},{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"}],"posters":[],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"André Delvaux","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":39271,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/39271","profile":""},{"name":"Julien Gracq","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":39272,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/39272","profile":""},{"name":"Ghislain Cloquet","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":11988,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/11988","profile":""},{"name":"Claude Pignot","job":"Production Design","department":"Art","character":"","id":3527,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3527","profile":""},{"name":"Frédéric Devreese","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":39273,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/39273","profile":""},{"name":"Mag Bodard","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":26013,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/26013","profile":""},{"name":"Anna Karina","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Elle","id":18197,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/18197","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/yIzl4zqPJYwrelGn853XUpRu7RC.jpg"},{"name":"Mathieu Carrière","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Julien Eschenbach","id":36925,"order":1,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/36925","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/mp1N8saPQMvrOldl9crEN70TJ2U.jpg"},{"name":"Roger Van Hool","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Jacques Neuil","id":28190,"order":2,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/28190","profile":""},{"name":"Luce Garcia-Ville","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Madame Neuil","id":28277,"order":3,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/28277","profile":""},{"name":"Bulle Ogier","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Odile","id":38341,"order":4,"cast_id":11,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/38341","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/poAFL9FNlAAytJP73wmOPSlJifU.jpg"},{"name":"Pierre Vernier","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Monsieur Hausman","id":18566,"order":5,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/18566","profile":""},{"name":"Boby Lapointe","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"l'aubergiste","id":32323,"order":6,"cast_id":13,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/32323","profile":""},{"name":"Martine Sarcey","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Madame Hausmann","id":23673,"order":7,"cast_id":14,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/23673","profile":""},{"name":"Jean Bouise","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"le rédacteur","id":2168,"order":8,"cast_id":15,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/2168","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/rBFl7KVzK2tax2CUbLtJBFFcBzm.jpg"}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":59,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 18:11:36 UTC"}]
