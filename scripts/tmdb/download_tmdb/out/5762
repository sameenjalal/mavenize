(Lisa Howard), have, for the last time, ticked off mobster Wald (Tony Curtis) by apprehending his rather inept henchmen just as they are about to commit a robbery or kill one of Wald's enemies. That's when Wald turns their fate over to the ruthless Crazy Carlos (Steve Bacic), with the intention of having Bellini and B.B. killed. But the hapless bounty hunters keep having good luck just when they need it most. ~ Buzz McClain, Rovi","keywords":["ganove"],"released":"1997-07-02","runtime":87,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZS1qFlk84E","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/thriller","name":"Thriller","id":53}],"studios":[{"name":"Bounty Films Production Ltd.","id":1977,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/1977-bounty-films-production-ltd"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/rL1QOyOpoFCXnhsvSLp3i9SoGWm.jpg","id":"4ed614567b9aa10c8500380d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/rL1QOyOpoFCXnhsvSLp3i9SoGWm.jpg","id":"4ed614567b9aa10c8500380d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/rL1QOyOpoFCXnhsvSLp3i9SoGWm.jpg","id":"4ed614567b9aa10c8500380d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/rL1QOyOpoFCXnhsvSLp3i9SoGWm.jpg","id":"4ed614567b9aa10c8500380d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/rL1QOyOpoFCXnhsvSLp3i9SoGWm.jpg","id":"4ed614567b9aa10c8500380d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":600,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/rL1QOyOpoFCXnhsvSLp3i9SoGWm.jpg","id":"4ed614567b9aa10c8500380d"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"George Erschbamer","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":45427,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/45427","profile":""},{"name":"Jeffrey Barmash","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":47100,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47100","profile":""},{"name":"John Dunning","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":31180,"order":0,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/31180","profile":""},{"name":"Leon Aronson","job":"Music","department":"Sound","character":"","id":47101,"order":0,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47101","profile":""},{"name":"Brian Pearson","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":47102,"order":0,"cast_id":11,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47102","profile":""},{"name":"Mark Sanders","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":5933,"order":0,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/5933","profile":""},{"name":"Michael Dudikoff","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Jersey Bellini","id":21259,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/21259","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/lG8nBtg93H4FHH9CGCp635jZAKF.jpg"},{"name":"Lisa Howard","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"B.
