Amidst the clutter, Amy unearths a beautiful antique mirror and immediately is overcome by a deep inner desire to caress and explore her luscious body in ways she never thought possible. Amy quickly buys the mirror only to discover the ghostly legend of the sexually insatiable whorehouse madame trapped inside it. Powerless to control herself, Amy indulges her naughtiest fantasies when standing before the shimmering mirror. Soon all her female friends are introduced to its seductive supernatural energy, and none of them can deny the lesbian urges that overtake their sweet young bodies, transforming them into writhing sex-machines that cannot be satisfied. But amidst the moans of pleasure, how could Amy possibly realize the terrifying consequences of her actions, and the fate the ghost in the mirror has in store for each of them. Will it be infinite ecstasy or endless erotic longing?","keywords":["mirrow","kleines m√§dchen","sexappeal"],"released":"2002-03-26","runtime":117,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/erotic","name":"Erotic","id":2916},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/horror","name":"Horror","id":27}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/kSvt3LvYHnFphrugqaAl9JYY003.jpg","id":"4ea60d48a34d4b41fd00036d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/kSvt3LvYHnFphrugqaAl9JYY003.jpg","id":"4ea60d48a34d4b41fd00036d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/kSvt3LvYHnFphrugqaAl9JYY003.jpg","id":"4ea60d48a34d4b41fd00036d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":479,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/kSvt3LvYHnFphrugqaAl9JYY003.jpg","id":"4ea60d48a34d4b41fd00036d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":700,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/kSvt3LvYHnFphrugqaAl9JYY003.jpg","id":"4ea60d48a34d4b41fd00036d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":560,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/kSvt3LvYHnFphrugqaAl9JYY003.jpg","id":"4ea60d48a34d4b41fd00036d"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Pete Jacelone","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":35612,"order":0,"cast_id":23,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35612","profile":""},{"name":"John Paul Fedele","job":"Additional Camera","department":"Camera","character":"","id":31381,"order":0,"cast_id":22,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/31381","profile":""},{"name":"Pete Jacelone","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":35612,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35612","profile":""},{"name":"Dennis Peterson","job":"Music","department":"Sound","character":"","id":35615,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35615","profile":""},{"name":"Francis Anthony McGlynn","job":"Music","department":"Sound","character":"","id":35614,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35614","profile":""},{"name":"Bobby Gonzo","job":"Casting","department":"Production","character":"","id":35616,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35616","profile":""},{"name":"Anthony Pepe","job":"Makeup Artist","department":"Costume & Make-Up","character":"","id":35617,"order":0,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35617","profile":""},{"name":"Clancy Fitzsimmons","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":31371,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/31371","profile":""},{"name":"Pete Jacelone","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":35612,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35612","profile":""},{"name":"Laurie Wallace","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Amy","id":35618,"order":0,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35618","profile":""},{"name":"Major Dodge","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Bill","id":35619,"order":1,"cast_id":11,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35619","profile":""},{"name":"Darian Caine","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"The Lady in the Mirror","id":31376,"order":2,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/31376","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/9AxDJaQZFu9xGjRXoQclLazBY1T.jpg"},{"name":"Ruby Larocca","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Stacy","id":35621,"order":3,"cast_id":13,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35621","profile":""},{"name":"A.J.
