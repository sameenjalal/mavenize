But in the course of a single day he accidentally captures on film the commission of a murder. The fact that he has photographed a murder does not occur to him until he studies and then blows up his negatives, uncovering details, blowing up smaller and smaller elements, and finally putting the puzzle together.","keywords":["london","frauenleiche","1960s","photographer","burglar","tennis","loss of sense of reality","suspicion of murder","reality","publishing
