In order to do so, Medem edits the interviews giving a sense of dialogue between parties that refused to sit down and talk. Due to its lack of contextualization, the film may be hard to understand to audiences without previous knowledge of the Basque problem—it is obviously a film designed to be viewed by Spanish audiences, or people familiar with the issues.","keywords":["terror","spain","opression","liberation","basque country "],"released":"2003-09-20","runtime":110,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/documentary","name":"Documentary","id":99}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"},{"code":"eu","name":"Basque","native_name":"euskera"},{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"},{"code":"es","name":"Spanish","native_name":"Español"}],"countries":[{"code":"ES","name":"Spain","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/es"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":132,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/25d1EE5T5xC4eR1UTq9lrRPlUpK.jpg","id":"4ea5eccf2c058837cb001c2b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":220,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/25d1EE5T5xC4eR1UTq9lrRPlUpK.jpg","id":"4ea5eccf2c058837cb001c2b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":265,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/25d1EE5T5xC4eR1UTq9lrRPlUpK.jpg","id":"4ea5eccf2c058837cb001c2b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":489,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/25d1EE5T5xC4eR1UTq9lrRPlUpK.jpg","id":"4ea5eccf2c058837cb001c2b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":715,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/25d1EE5T5xC4eR1UTq9lrRPlUpK.jpg","id":"4ea5eccf2c058837cb001c2b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1600,"width":1119,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/25d1EE5T5xC4eR1UTq9lrRPlUpK.jpg","id":"4ea5eccf2c058837cb001c2b"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Julio Medem","job":"Author","department":"Writing","character":"","id":16435,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/16435","profile":""},{"name":"Julio Medem","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":16435,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/16435","profile":""},{"name":"Julio Medem","job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":16435,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/16435","profile":""},{"name":"Koldo Zuazua","job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":25895,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/25895","profile":""},{"name":"Koldo Zuazua","job":"Production Manager","department":"Production","character":"","id":25895,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/25895","profile":""},{"name":"Ricardo de Gracia","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":25896,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/25896","profile":""},{"name":"Javier Aguirre","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":25897,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/25897","profile":""},{"name":"Daniel Sosa Segura","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":25898,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/25898","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":85,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 17:09:55 UTC"}]
