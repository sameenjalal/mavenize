The family is now near ruin, but Adélaïde and Félicie nonetheless still squander away the family money on themselves and keeping beautiful, whereas Belle slaves around the house, doting on her father. Ludovic detests his two spoiled sisters, but is protective of Belle, especially with his friend Avenant, a handsome scoundrel who wants to marry Belle. Crossing the forest one dark and stormy evening, the father gets lost and takes refuge in a fantastical castle. Upon leaving, he steals a blossom off a rose bush, which Belle requested. The castle's resident, an angry beast, sentences him to one of two options for the theft of the rose: his own death, or that of one of his daughters. As she feels she is the cause of her father's predicament (despite her sisters asking for far more lavish gifts).","keywords":["underdog","monster","beauty","rose","daughter"],"released":"1947-01-01","runtime":96,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isy43UcKPOw","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/fantasy","name":"Fantasy","id":14},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/foreign","name":"Foreign","id":10769},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/romance","name":"Romance","id":10749},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/science-fiction","name":"Science
