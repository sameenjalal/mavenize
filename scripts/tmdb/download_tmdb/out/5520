Spending most of her life in and out of various institutions, Christine has long yearned for independence, but is unable to wrest free of her controlling mother, Helen (Lynn Redgrave). Upon Helen's death, her other daughter, Judy (Elizabeth Perkins), a successful, self-absorbed art director who has deliberately distanced herself from her family, is appointed trustee of the troubled Christine. The rest of the film chronicles Judy's frustrated efforts to balance her sister's needs with her own, and Christine's ongoing ambition to stand on her own two feet.","keywords":["loss of mother","sister sister relationship","sister"],"released":"2002-01-27","runtime":90,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":92,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/dTTLBAwACyTlkmls6TSKasS5h14.jpg","id":"4ea5ee5834f8633bdc0022a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":154,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/dTTLBAwACyTlkmls6TSKasS5h14.jpg","id":"4ea5ee5834f8633bdc0022a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":185,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/dTTLBAwACyTlkmls6TSKasS5h14.jpg","id":"4ea5ee5834f8633bdc0022a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":342,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/dTTLBAwACyTlkmls6TSKasS5h14.jpg","id":"4ea5ee5834f8633bdc0022a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":500,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/dTTLBAwACyTlkmls6TSKasS5h14.jpg","id":"4ea5ee5834f8633bdc0022a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":600,"width":600,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/dTTLBAwACyTlkmls6TSKasS5h14.jpg","id":"4ea5ee5834f8633bdc0022a9"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Sabrina Plisco","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":23544,"order":0,"cast_id":14,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/23544","profile":""},{"name":"Brent Shields","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":43890,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/43890","profile":""},{"name":"Susan Tarr","job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":43889,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/43889","profile":""},{"name":"Margaret Moorman","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":43888,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/43888","profile":""},{"name":"Lawrence Shragge","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":29294,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/29294","profile":""},{"name":"Lloyd Ahern II","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":43891,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/43891","profile":""},{"name":"Ron Lagomarsino","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":43887,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/43887","profile":""},{"name":"Kathy Bates","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Christine Chapman","id":8534,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/8534","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/dliVEvUADyBExhLr3EWrWDCeFub.jpg"},{"name":"Elizabeth Perkins","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Judy Chapman","id":20,"order":1,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/20","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/4g5SvC4P5WLo8SAVs0KGokXGXKd.jpg"},{"name":"Lynn Redgrave","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Helen Margaret Chapman","id":29791,"order":2,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/29791","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/u9Fz8nmHg2nGCVRpbasTJQlpUkG.jpg"},{"name":"Kimberly J.
