Is the man going insane?

his delusions as more \"real\" than reality.","keywords":[],"released":"1964-09-01","runtime":92,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/bpwoeK3kOXsbAQza8geNGIvnuWC.jpg","id":"4ea5f1962c058837cb00204b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/bpwoeK3kOXsbAQza8geNGIvnuWC.jpg","id":"4ea5f1962c058837cb00204b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":260,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/bpwoeK3kOXsbAQza8geNGIvnuWC.jpg","id":"4ea5f1962c058837cb00204b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":481,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/bpwoeK3kOXsbAQza8geNGIvnuWC.jpg","id":"4ea5f1962c058837cb00204b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":703,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/bpwoeK3kOXsbAQza8geNGIvnuWC.jpg","id":"4ea5f1962c058837cb00204b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1446,"width":1029,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/bpwoeK3kOXsbAQza8geNGIvnuWC.jpg","id":"4ea5f1962c058837cb00204b"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/Y2wwmbbYgsFp9RDEgQveDZ3ypK.jpg","id":"4ea5f1942c058837cb002049"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/Y2wwmbbYgsFp9RDEgQveDZ3ypK.jpg","id":"4ea5f1942c058837cb002049"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/Y2wwmbbYgsFp9RDEgQveDZ3ypK.jpg","id":"4ea5f1942c058837cb002049"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/Y2wwmbbYgsFp9RDEgQveDZ3ypK.jpg","id":"4ea5f1942c058837cb002049"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Alain
