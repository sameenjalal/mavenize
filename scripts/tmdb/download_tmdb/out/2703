Suddenly, a child's voice, frightened, questioning, pierces the darkness... The first flickering rays of light begin to sculpt mysterious shapes out of the darkness ... Among them, a very old man. He reassures the child, exhorting him to see the wonders of the earth. And it is with this child's eyes that we will witness the creation of the world.","keywords":["bible"],"released":"1994-09-16","runtime":91,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/history","name":"History","id":36}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"DE","name":"Germany","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/de"},{"code":"IT","name":"Italy","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/it"},{"code":"MA","name":"Morocco","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/ma"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":139,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/cJBPh8bHL0aVGUZCYkKgmkt7mdS.jpg","id":"4ea60339a34d4b3d2d001205"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":233,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/cJBPh8bHL0aVGUZCYkKgmkt7mdS.jpg","id":"4ea60339a34d4b3d2d001205"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":280,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/cJBPh8bHL0aVGUZCYkKgmkt7mdS.jpg","id":"4ea60339a34d4b3d2d001205"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":518,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/cJBPh8bHL0aVGUZCYkKgmkt7mdS.jpg","id":"4ea60339a34d4b3d2d001205"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":757,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/cJBPh8bHL0aVGUZCYkKgmkt7mdS.jpg","id":"4ea60339a34d4b3d2d001205"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":648,"width":428,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/cJBPh8bHL0aVGUZCYkKgmkt7mdS.jpg","id":"4ea60339a34d4b3d2d001205"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Omero Antonutti","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Erzähler","id":27208,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27208","profile":""},{"name":"Omero Antonutti","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Noah","id":27208,"order":1,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27208","profile":""},{"name":"Sabir Aziz","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Adam","id":27209,"order":2,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27209","profile":""},{"name":"Haddou Zoubida","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Eva","id":27210,"order":3,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27210","profile":""},{"name":"Annabi Abdelialil","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Kain","id":27211,"order":4,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/27211","profile":""},{"name":"B.
