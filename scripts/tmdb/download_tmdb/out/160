Popular legend has it that, when this film was shown, the first-night audience fled the café in terror, fearing being run over by the \"approaching\" train. This legend has since been identified as promotional embellishment, though there is evidence to suggest that people were astounded at the capabilities of the Lumières' cinématographe.","keywords":["france","zug","train station","cinema","beginning","film and cinema"],"released":"1895-12-28","runtime":1,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/documentary","name":"Documentary","id":99},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/short","name":"Short","id":10755}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":93,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/x024rl0ZK5KRE90XxId1MszSr9M.jpg","id":"4ea5c5fb34f8633bdc000407"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":156,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/x024rl0ZK5KRE90XxId1MszSr9M.jpg","id":"4ea5c5fb34f8633bdc000407"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":187,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/x024rl0ZK5KRE90XxId1MszSr9M.jpg","id":"4ea5c5fb34f8633bdc000407"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":345,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/x024rl0ZK5KRE90XxId1MszSr9M.jpg","id":"4ea5c5fb34f8633bdc000407"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":505,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/x024rl0ZK5KRE90XxId1MszSr9M.jpg","id":"4ea5c5fb34f8633bdc000407"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":505,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/x024rl0ZK5KRE90XxId1MszSr9M.jpg","id":"4ea5c5fb34f8633bdc000407"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Auguste Lumière","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":1867,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/1867","profile":""},{"name":"Louis Lumière","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":1868,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/1868","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":48,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 15:58:43 UTC"}]
