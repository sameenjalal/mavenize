Though the film is not a musical, it won André Previn an Academy Award for Best Score Adaptation or Treatment. There is also a scene in the film, in which Shirley MacLaine exclaims \"Dis-donc!\" whilst dancing on a table, which appears to be a deliberate tribute to the musical from which the film is derived. The film was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Shirley MacLaine) and Best Cinematography, Color.","keywords":["paris","illegale prostitution","prostitute","polizeibeamter","love of one's life","gesellschaftliche werte","ex-polizist","pub"],"released":"1963-06-05","runtime":135,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgrEynddh7I","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/romance","name":"Romance","id":10749}],"studios":[{"name":"Phalanx Productions","id":1167,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/1167-phalanx-productions"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":128,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/qaeqKVyziMXGzBU7HDYCjSEP3Mn.jpg","id":"4ea5e67434f8633bdc001d0b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":213,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/qaeqKVyziMXGzBU7HDYCjSEP3Mn.jpg","id":"4ea5e67434f8633bdc001d0b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":256,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/qaeqKVyziMXGzBU7HDYCjSEP3Mn.jpg","id":"4ea5e67434f8633bdc001d0b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":474,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/qaeqKVyziMXGzBU7HDYCjSEP3Mn.jpg","id":"4ea5e67434f8633bdc001d0b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":693,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/qaeqKVyziMXGzBU7HDYCjSEP3Mn.jpg","id":"4ea5e67434f8633bdc001d0b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":923,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/qaeqKVyziMXGzBU7HDYCjSEP3Mn.jpg","id":"4ea5e67434f8633bdc001d0b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":117,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/rowfml0NgJRS5vdVSAwAN8iqLy7.jpg","id":"4ea5e67234f8633bdc001d09"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":196,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/rowfml0NgJRS5vdVSAwAN8iqLy7.jpg","id":"4ea5e67234f8633bdc001d09"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":236,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/rowfml0NgJRS5vdVSAwAN8iqLy7.jpg","id":"4ea5e67234f8633bdc001d09"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":435,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/rowfml0NgJRS5vdVSAwAN8iqLy7.jpg","id":"4ea5e67234f8633bdc001d09"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":637,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/rowfml0NgJRS5vdVSAwAN8iqLy7.jpg","id":"4ea5e67234f8633bdc001d09"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1273,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/rowfml0NgJRS5vdVSAwAN8iqLy7.jpg","id":"4ea5e67234f8633bdc001d09"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/ydM7IDytrPj0VFkNZ9gGkn403jS.jpg","id":"4ea5e66f34f8633bdc001d07"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/ydM7IDytrPj0VFkNZ9gGkn403jS.jpg","id":"4ea5e66f34f8633bdc001d07"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/ydM7IDytrPj0VFkNZ9gGkn403jS.jpg","id":"4ea5e66f34f8633bdc001d07"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/ydM7IDytrPj0VFkNZ9gGkn403jS.jpg","id":"4ea5e66f34f8633bdc001d07"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Billy Wilder","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":3146,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3146","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1hDAFo3qEIS6QRDQhZR9WljSLTU.jpg"},{"name":"Billy Wilder","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":3146,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3146","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1hDAFo3qEIS6QRDQhZR9WljSLTU.jpg"},{"name":"I.A.L.
