With his long-time pal Gage acting as his manager, he's trying to lay down a demo tape with cut-rate studio time. To pay the bills, he and Gage run drugs for \"Mr. B.\" Inside a week, Diamond's beloved mother dies suddenly, his father appears after an absence of 12 years and wants a relationship, and his girlfriend Kia tells him she's pregnant, asking him if he's ready to be a father. Gage steals $100,000 in a multiple-felony robbery so that Diamond can record a full album, not knowing it's Mr. B's money he's taken. B wants his money, Diamond wants his music, Tia wants an answer.","keywords":["single parent","rap","loss of mother","socially deprived family","rapper"],"released":"2000-09-06","runtime":86,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/crime","name":"Crime","id":80},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/musical","name":"Musical","id":22}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vTlO23UK213zvDQJQwfmJpcSpHD.jpg","id":"4ea6092834f8633bdc003591"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vTlO23UK213zvDQJQwfmJpcSpHD.jpg","id":"4ea6092834f8633bdc003591"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vTlO23UK213zvDQJQwfmJpcSpHD.jpg","id":"4ea6092834f8633bdc003591"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":514,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vTlO23UK213zvDQJQwfmJpcSpHD.jpg","id":"4ea6092834f8633bdc003591"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":752,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vTlO23UK213zvDQJQwfmJpcSpHD.jpg","id":"4ea6092834f8633bdc003591"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1001,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vTlO23UK213zvDQJQwfmJpcSpHD.jpg","id":"4ea6092834f8633bdc003591"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Robert Adetuyi","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":31120,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/31120","profile":""},{"name":"Robert Adetuyi","job":"Author","department":"Writing","character":"","id":31120,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/31120","profile":""},{"name":"Ray 'Cory' Daniels","job":"Author","department":"Writing","character":"","id":61645,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/61645","profile":""},{"name":"Lennox Parris","job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":61648,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/61648","profile":""},{"name":"Guy Oseary","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":61647,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/61647","profile":""},{"name":"Kelly Hilaire","job":"Author","department":"Writing","character":"","id":61646,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/61646","profile":""},{"name":"Hubert Taczanowski","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":59871,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/59871","profile":""},{"name":"Happy Walters","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":21933,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/21933","profile":""},{"name":"E.
