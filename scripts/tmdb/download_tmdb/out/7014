This streak of non-conformism also extends to sex, as Piccoli contrives to elicit uninhibited behavior from many of the females (be they nubile or frustrated) around him – including the secretary, Marilu' Tolo, he had been caught unwittingly peeping on and subsequently seduced.","keywords":["kanibalismus"],"released":"1973-03-01","runtime":104,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/horror","name":"Horror","id":27},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/indie","name":"Indie","id":10756}],"studios":[{"name":"Filmanthrope","id":2170,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/2170-filmanthrope"},{"name":"Les Productions FDL","id":2171,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/2171-les-productions-fdl"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/8dAv4QXGhMsJ6rGuDgW9f5nWtVk.jpg","id":"4ea5fcd24f13c137cc00268f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":206,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/8dAv4QXGhMsJ6rGuDgW9f5nWtVk.jpg","id":"4ea5fcd24f13c137cc00268f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":248,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/8dAv4QXGhMsJ6rGuDgW9f5nWtVk.jpg","id":"4ea5fcd24f13c137cc00268f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":459,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/8dAv4QXGhMsJ6rGuDgW9f5nWtVk.jpg","id":"4ea5fcd24f13c137cc00268f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":670,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/8dAv4QXGhMsJ6rGuDgW9f5nWtVk.jpg","id":"4ea5fcd24f13c137cc00268f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":893,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/8dAv4QXGhMsJ6rGuDgW9f5nWtVk.jpg","id":"4ea5fcd24f13c137cc00268f"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Michel Piccoli","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Themroc","id":3784,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3784","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/yIMVztttTZrK23sC6THD5yGpdlq.jpg"},{"name":"Miou-Miou","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Voisine","id":4274,"order":1,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/4274","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/745PQbQKNVwGrwtGvSOlg4lk5Bx.jpg"},{"name":"Béatrice Romand","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"La soeur de Themroc","id":28611,"order":2,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/28611","profile":""},{"name":"Marilù Tolo","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"La secrétaire","id":51839,"order":3,"cast_id":11,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51839","profile":""},{"name":"Francesca Romana Coluzzi","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"La voisine","id":51840,"order":4,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51840","profile":""},{"name":"Jeanne Herviale","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"La mère de Themroc","id":25126,"order":5,"cast_id":13,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/25126","profile":""},{"name":"Claude Faraldo","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":51833,"order":0,"cast_id":14,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51833","profile":""},{"name":"Noun Serra","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":51837,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51837","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/z9PAknIrFoJwzHS7ogtayEAJY0u.jpg"},{"name":"François de Lannurien","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":51836,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51836","profile":""},{"name":"Helène Vager","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":51835,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51835","profile":""},{"name":"Jean-Marc Ripert","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":51838,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51838","profile":""},{"name":"Harald Maury","job":"Sound Designer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":49504,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/49504","profile":""},{"name":"Claude Faraldo","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":51833,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51833","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":157,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 17:14:52 UTC"}]
