A stranger comes to the house - Ruth's cousin - with a picture of Ruth, age 8, in Berlin, with a woman the cousin says helped Ruth escape. Hannah, Ruth's daughter engaged to a gentile, goes to Berlin to find the woman, Lena Fisher, now 90. Posing as a journalist investigating intermarriage, Hannah interviews Lena who tells the story of a week in 1943 when the Jewish husbands of Aryan women were detained in a building on Rosenstrasse. The women gather daily for word of their husbands. The film goes back and forth to tell Ruth and Lena's story. How will it affect Hannah?","keywords":["berlin","deportation","nazis","protest"],"released":"2003-09-18","runtime":136,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/foreign","name":"Foreign","id":10769},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/history","name":"History","id":36}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"de","name":"German","native_name":"Deutsch"},{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"DE","name":"Germany","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/de"},{"code":"NL","name":"Netherlands","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/nl"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":133,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/4PFRxQMxAI2897bY1h7KBp7YKEZ.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a22c058837cb00263f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":222,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/4PFRxQMxAI2897bY1h7KBp7YKEZ.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a22c058837cb00263f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":267,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/4PFRxQMxAI2897bY1h7KBp7YKEZ.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a22c058837cb00263f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":494,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/4PFRxQMxAI2897bY1h7KBp7YKEZ.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a22c058837cb00263f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":722,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/4PFRxQMxAI2897bY1h7KBp7YKEZ.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a22c058837cb00263f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1443,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/4PFRxQMxAI2897bY1h7KBp7YKEZ.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a22c058837cb00263f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/irAyoMx8xQ0ox8MQvHc6oWfPAn3.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a02c058837cb00263d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/irAyoMx8xQ0ox8MQvHc6oWfPAn3.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a02c058837cb00263d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/irAyoMx8xQ0ox8MQvHc6oWfPAn3.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a02c058837cb00263d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/irAyoMx8xQ0ox8MQvHc6oWfPAn3.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a02c058837cb00263d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/irAyoMx8xQ0ox8MQvHc6oWfPAn3.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a02c058837cb00263d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/irAyoMx8xQ0ox8MQvHc6oWfPAn3.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a02c058837cb00263d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/jyHh0CpTZ4hXGDtXWi6Y6BAUVyP.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a42c058837cb002641"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/jyHh0CpTZ4hXGDtXWi6Y6BAUVyP.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a42c058837cb002641"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/jyHh0CpTZ4hXGDtXWi6Y6BAUVyP.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a42c058837cb002641"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/jyHh0CpTZ4hXGDtXWi6Y6BAUVyP.jpg","id":"4ea5f8a42c058837cb002641"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Pamela
