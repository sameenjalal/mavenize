Multiple attempts to assault the cartel's mountainous compound have been thwarted by a Scorpion-attack helicopter piloted by a cartel leader, Eric Stoller (Bert Rhine). After having several aircraft shot down, most notably a pair of UH–60 Black Hawks and their AH–1 Cobra escorts, the army turns to the new AH–64 Apache attack helicopter, which can match its enemies' maneuverability and firepower.","keywords":["flying","rauschgift","helicopter"],"released":"1990-01-01","runtime":85,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/adventure","name":"Adventure","id":12}],"studios":[{"name":"Nova International Films","id":2098,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/2098-nova-international-films"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":132,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/2MIK5LPiPR5PjoekitK29yReaHH.jpg","id":"4ea5f10234f8633bdc00248f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":222,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/2MIK5LPiPR5PjoekitK29yReaHH.jpg","id":"4ea5f10234f8633bdc00248f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":266,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/2MIK5LPiPR5PjoekitK29yReaHH.jpg","id":"4ea5f10234f8633bdc00248f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":492,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/2MIK5LPiPR5PjoekitK29yReaHH.jpg","id":"4ea5f10234f8633bdc00248f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":719,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/2MIK5LPiPR5PjoekitK29yReaHH.jpg","id":"4ea5f10234f8633bdc00248f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":695,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/2MIK5LPiPR5PjoekitK29yReaHH.jpg","id":"4ea5f10234f8633bdc00248f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/6XsRAdzZgR0QguDVYtKOcjPxZJn.jpg","id":"4ea5f10834f8633bdc002493"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/6XsRAdzZgR0QguDVYtKOcjPxZJn.jpg","id":"4ea5f10834f8633bdc002493"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/6XsRAdzZgR0QguDVYtKOcjPxZJn.jpg","id":"4ea5f10834f8633bdc002493"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6XsRAdzZgR0QguDVYtKOcjPxZJn.jpg","id":"4ea5f10834f8633bdc002493"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/6XsRAdzZgR0QguDVYtKOcjPxZJn.jpg","id":"4ea5f10834f8633bdc002493"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6XsRAdzZgR0QguDVYtKOcjPxZJn.jpg","id":"4ea5f10834f8633bdc002493"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/1nZJnpk2BgkZs0uXjk3xEeiMeWF.jpg","id":"4ea5f10534f8633bdc002491"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/1nZJnpk2BgkZs0uXjk3xEeiMeWF.jpg","id":"4ea5f10534f8633bdc002491"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/1nZJnpk2BgkZs0uXjk3xEeiMeWF.jpg","id":"4ea5f10534f8633bdc002491"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1nZJnpk2BgkZs0uXjk3xEeiMeWF.jpg","id":"4ea5f10534f8633bdc002491"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Nicolas Cage","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Jake Preston","id":2963,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/2963","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/bqG7Dxd9uzA5lnRv2UzVYVayYSM.jpg"},{"name":"Tommy Lee Jones","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Brad Little","id":2176,"order":1,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/2176","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/iiBuPulxoMtJJj6VVcNOPBKcq76.jpg"},{"name":"Sean Young","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Billie Lee Guthries","id":586,"order":2,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/586","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/ceL8LsNud7i7nNZzd5Z5aK5xZW6.jpg"},{"name":"Bryan Kestner","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Breaker","id":51916,"order":3,"cast_id":12,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/51916","profile":""},{"name":"Dale Dye","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"A.K.
