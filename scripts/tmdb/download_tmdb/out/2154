A mysterious systems failure causes the crew of a spaceship to be stranded on the dark side of the moon, while rapidly running out of fuel and oxygen. They are surprised to discover a NASA space shuttle floating in space, and board it in the hope of salvaging some supplies. One by one, the crew is possessed and killed, and it is up to Paxton Warner to find the links between the dark side of the moon, the Bermuda Triangle, and the Devil himself.","keywords":["space marine","satellit"],"released":"1990-05-30","runtime":96,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueQLIiXOC0c","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/horror","name":"Horror","id":27},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/thriller","name":"Thriller","id":53},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/science-fiction","name":"Science Fiction","id":878}],"studios":[{"name":"Wildstreet Pictures","id":993,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/993-wildstreet-pictures"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vh7v0ehC9BTBtrn6qOjVhxRllsW.jpg","id":"4ea5ece44f13c137cc001a5d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vh7v0ehC9BTBtrn6qOjVhxRllsW.jpg","id":"4ea5ece44f13c137cc001a5d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vh7v0ehC9BTBtrn6qOjVhxRllsW.jpg","id":"4ea5ece44f13c137cc001a5d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vh7v0ehC9BTBtrn6qOjVhxRllsW.jpg","id":"4ea5ece44f13c137cc001a5d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":705,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vh7v0ehC9BTBtrn6qOjVhxRllsW.jpg","id":"4ea5ece44f13c137cc001a5d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":310,"width":220,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vh7v0ehC9BTBtrn6qOjVhxRllsW.jpg","id":"4ea5ece44f13c137cc001a5d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":135,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vJXFPKqPR7bNp19kLzboYT4JI0E.jpg","id":"4ea5ece64f13c137cc001a5f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":226,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vJXFPKqPR7bNp19kLzboYT4JI0E.jpg","id":"4ea5ece64f13c137cc001a5f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":271,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vJXFPKqPR7bNp19kLzboYT4JI0E.jpg","id":"4ea5ece64f13c137cc001a5f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":501,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vJXFPKqPR7bNp19kLzboYT4JI0E.jpg","id":"4ea5ece64f13c137cc001a5f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":732,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vJXFPKqPR7bNp19kLzboYT4JI0E.jpg","id":"4ea5ece64f13c137cc001a5f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1024,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vJXFPKqPR7bNp19kLzboYT4JI0E.jpg","id":"4ea5ece64f13c137cc001a5f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/uVSbDeX5F54yh4A7TMbIbBwPVNF.jpg","id":"4ea5ece94f13c137cc001a61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/uVSbDeX5F54yh4A7TMbIbBwPVNF.jpg","id":"4ea5ece94f13c137cc001a61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/uVSbDeX5F54yh4A7TMbIbBwPVNF.jpg","id":"4ea5ece94f13c137cc001a61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/uVSbDeX5F54yh4A7TMbIbBwPVNF.jpg","id":"4ea5ece94f13c137cc001a61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/uVSbDeX5F54yh4A7TMbIbBwPVNF.jpg","id":"4ea5ece94f13c137cc001a61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":827,"width":559,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/uVSbDeX5F54yh4A7TMbIbBwPVNF.jpg","id":"4ea5ece94f13c137cc001a61"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/1cRqyt7JYMUkDZmHjZ4WWJqAF1c.jpg","id":"4ea5ece24f13c137cc001a5b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/1cRqyt7JYMUkDZmHjZ4WWJqAF1c.jpg","id":"4ea5ece24f13c137cc001a5b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/1cRqyt7JYMUkDZmHjZ4WWJqAF1c.jpg","id":"4ea5ece24f13c137cc001a5b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1cRqyt7JYMUkDZmHjZ4WWJqAF1c.jpg","id":"4ea5ece24f13c137cc001a5b"}}],"cast":[{"name":"D.J.
