Ruthie calls Or \"my treasure,\" but Ruthie is a burden. She's just out of hospital, weak, and Or has found her a job as a house cleaner. The call of the quick money on the street is tough for Ruthie to ignore. Or's emotions roil further when the mother of the youth she's in love with comes to the flat to warn her off. With love fading and Ruthie perhaps beyond help, Or's choices narrow.","keywords":["illegale prostitution","prostitute","mutter-tochter-beziehung","armer lehrer","tel aviv","escort service"],"released":"2004-09-16","runtime":95,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"he","name":"Hebrew","native_name":""}],"countries":[{"code":"IL","name":"Israel","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/il"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":122,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/yuCsB4vgQz5Uf8OwlTSP5G1D9Y6.jpg","id":"4ea5fc75a34d4b3d2d000d71"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":203,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/yuCsB4vgQz5Uf8OwlTSP5G1D9Y6.jpg","id":"4ea5fc75a34d4b3d2d000d71"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":244,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/yuCsB4vgQz5Uf8OwlTSP5G1D9Y6.jpg","id":"4ea5fc75a34d4b3d2d000d71"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":452,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/yuCsB4vgQz5Uf8OwlTSP5G1D9Y6.jpg","id":"4ea5fc75a34d4b3d2d000d71"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":661,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/yuCsB4vgQz5Uf8OwlTSP5G1D9Y6.jpg","id":"4ea5fc75a34d4b3d2d000d71"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":757,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/yuCsB4vgQz5Uf8OwlTSP5G1D9Y6.jpg","id":"4ea5fc75a34d4b3d2d000d71"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Keren Yedaya","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":19939,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19939","profile":""},{"name":"Keren Yedaya","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":19940,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19940","profile":""},{"name":"Sari Ezouz","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":19941,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19941","profile":""},{"name":"Ronit Elkabetz","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Ruthie","id":19942,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19942","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/nokLI2WYUaKRWqHho3IIMiHSMVB.jpg"},{"name":"Dana Ivgy","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Or","id":19943,"order":1,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19943","profile":""},{"name":"Meshar Cohen","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Ido","id":19944,"order":2,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19944","profile":""},{"name":"Katia Zinbris","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Rachel","id":19945,"order":3,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19945","profile":""},{"name":"Shmuel Edelman","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Shmuel","id":19946,"order":4,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19946","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":169,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 17:51:06 UTC"}]
