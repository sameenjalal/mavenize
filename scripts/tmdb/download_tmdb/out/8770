The controversial film examines in factual, logical, and yet startling terms how easy it is to change election outcomes and undermine election integrity across the U.S. Beyond increasing the public's awareness, UNCOUNTED inspires greater citizen involvement in fixing a broken electoral system.","keywords":["usa","u.s. president","election campaign"],"released":"2008-01-01","runtime":81,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"http://uncountedthemovie.com/","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/documentary","name":"Documentary","id":99}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":119,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/uMIXvB42gb0TRD8yDpAPIK1o9GT.jpg","id":"4f27f94c19c29520f2000cb5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":199,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/uMIXvB42gb0TRD8yDpAPIK1o9GT.jpg","id":"4f27f94c19c29520f2000cb5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":239,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/uMIXvB42gb0TRD8yDpAPIK1o9GT.jpg","id":"4f27f94c19c29520f2000cb5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":442,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/uMIXvB42gb0TRD8yDpAPIK1o9GT.jpg","id":"4f27f94c19c29520f2000cb5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":646,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/uMIXvB42gb0TRD8yDpAPIK1o9GT.jpg","id":"4f27f94c19c29520f2000cb5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":4266,"width":3300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/uMIXvB42gb0TRD8yDpAPIK1o9GT.jpg","id":"4f27f94c19c29520f2000cb5"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/g1e0wRe8i3GGYsp50BfwqS2YpXh.jpg","id":"4f288456760ee35a810019c1"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/g1e0wRe8i3GGYsp50BfwqS2YpXh.jpg","id":"4f288456760ee35a810019c1"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":721,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/g1e0wRe8i3GGYsp50BfwqS2YpXh.jpg","id":"4f288456760ee35a810019c1"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":721,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/g1e0wRe8i3GGYsp50BfwqS2YpXh.jpg","id":"4f288456760ee35a810019c1"}}],"cast":[{"name":"David Earnhardt","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":55942,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55942","profile":""},{"name":"David Earnhardt","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":55942,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55942","profile":""},{"name":"David Earnhardt","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":55942,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55942","profile":""},{"name":"Glenna Johnson","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":55943,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55943","profile":""},{"name":"Phil Bel","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":55944,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55944","profile":""},{"name":"Stacie Schwarz","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":55945,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55945","profile":""},{"name":"Mac Pirkel","job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":55946,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55946","profile":""},{"name":"Patricia Sommers Earnhardt","job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":55947,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55947","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":124,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 15:56:43 UTC"}]
