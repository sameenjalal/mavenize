Diaz, the most militant of the group, plans to kidnap the American ambassador Richard Poindexter, in a bid to draw attention to their cause. One of the group, Treuffais, a timid philosophy teacher, will have no part in this and walks away. His five comrades succeed in spiriting Poindexter away to a remote farmhouse. Unfortunately for them, the police chief who is assigned to the case sees the elimination of the terrorists as having much greater priority than rescuing the ambassador.","keywords":["anarchist"],"released":"1974-03-21","runtime":132,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/thriller","name":"Thriller","id":53},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/foreign","name":"Foreign","id":10769}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"fr","name":"French","native_name":"Français"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/sCBlK74jaDNwTVNKMv3zHboglX9.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd134f8633bdc0020e1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":207,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/sCBlK74jaDNwTVNKMv3zHboglX9.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd134f8633bdc0020e1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":248,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/sCBlK74jaDNwTVNKMv3zHboglX9.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd134f8633bdc0020e1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":459,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/sCBlK74jaDNwTVNKMv3zHboglX9.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd134f8633bdc0020e1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":671,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/sCBlK74jaDNwTVNKMv3zHboglX9.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd134f8633bdc0020e1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2012,"width":1500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/sCBlK74jaDNwTVNKMv3zHboglX9.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd134f8633bdc0020e1"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/pkDt2h8pkSC2FIOww4c77JuBoAa.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd434f8633bdc0020e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/pkDt2h8pkSC2FIOww4c77JuBoAa.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd434f8633bdc0020e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/pkDt2h8pkSC2FIOww4c77JuBoAa.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd434f8633bdc0020e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/pkDt2h8pkSC2FIOww4c77JuBoAa.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd434f8633bdc0020e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/xCAqPuupverQq8cDuGP6W8Tc7zs.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd734f8633bdc0020e5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/xCAqPuupverQq8cDuGP6W8Tc7zs.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd734f8633bdc0020e5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/xCAqPuupverQq8cDuGP6W8Tc7zs.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd734f8633bdc0020e5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/xCAqPuupverQq8cDuGP6W8Tc7zs.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd734f8633bdc0020e5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/8Wz4Hocf73dqWYUTFiJx1ueBxFw.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd934f8633bdc0020e7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/8Wz4Hocf73dqWYUTFiJx1ueBxFw.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd934f8633bdc0020e7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/8Wz4Hocf73dqWYUTFiJx1ueBxFw.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd934f8633bdc0020e7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/8Wz4Hocf73dqWYUTFiJx1ueBxFw.jpg","id":"4ea5ebd934f8633bdc0020e7"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Fabio
