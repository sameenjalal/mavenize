A hunting party is interrupted by the arrival of a notorious Count (Lothar Mehnert), who is believed to have murdered his brother. The uninvited guest sets in motion an elaborate plot to resurrect the ghosts of the past and bring to light the dark secret that lies at the center of his brother’s death.","keywords":["artist"],"released":"1921-02-01","runtime":59,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/horror","name":"Horror","id":27}],"studios":[{"name":"Mosch-Film","id":2023,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/2023-mosch-film"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"de","name":"German","native_name":"Deutsch"}],"countries":[{"code":"DE","name":"Germany","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/de"}],"posters":[],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"F.W.
