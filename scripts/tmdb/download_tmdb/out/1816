After the initial eliminations, seventeen hopefuls remain, among them Cassie (Alyson Reed), who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach. She is desperate enough for work to humble herself and audition for him; whether he's willing to let professionalism overcome his personal feelings about their past remains to be seen.As the film unfolds, the backstory of each of the dancers is revealed. Some are funny, some ironic, some heartbreaking. No matter what their background, however, they all have one thing in common - a passion for dance.","keywords":["lovesickness","dancer","dancing master","80s","dance","macho","dancing scene","musical","bad boss"],"released":"1985-12-10","runtime":113,"budget":0,"revenue":14202899,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/music","name":"Music","id":10402},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/musical","name":"Musical","id":22}],"studios":[{"name":"Embassy Film Associates","id":757,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/757-embassy-film-associates"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/iz2kXjhKcoQkBLQwFSEYVYefDhx.jpg","id":"4ea5e4659dc3d83c3b001419"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/iz2kXjhKcoQkBLQwFSEYVYefDhx.jpg","id":"4ea5e4659dc3d83c3b001419"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/iz2kXjhKcoQkBLQwFSEYVYefDhx.jpg","id":"4ea5e4659dc3d83c3b001419"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/iz2kXjhKcoQkBLQwFSEYVYefDhx.jpg","id":"4ea5e4659dc3d83c3b001419"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/iz2kXjhKcoQkBLQwFSEYVYefDhx.jpg","id":"4ea5e4659dc3d83c3b001419"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/iz2kXjhKcoQkBLQwFSEYVYefDhx.jpg","id":"4ea5e4659dc3d83c3b001419"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/9a6m3g360cIiIuwd7EnGwCl5eGV.jpg","id":"4ea5e4689dc3d83c3b00141b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/9a6m3g360cIiIuwd7EnGwCl5eGV.jpg","id":"4ea5e4689dc3d83c3b00141b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/9a6m3g360cIiIuwd7EnGwCl5eGV.jpg","id":"4ea5e4689dc3d83c3b00141b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":507,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/9a6m3g360cIiIuwd7EnGwCl5eGV.jpg","id":"4ea5e4689dc3d83c3b00141b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":741,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/9a6m3g360cIiIuwd7EnGwCl5eGV.jpg","id":"4ea5e4689dc3d83c3b00141b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":675,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/9a6m3g360cIiIuwd7EnGwCl5eGV.jpg","id":"4ea5e4689dc3d83c3b00141b"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/8mJOf0Y2ZhS89MYye9MM3olmUFP.jpg","id":"4ea5e4619dc3d83c3b001417"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/8mJOf0Y2ZhS89MYye9MM3olmUFP.jpg","id":"4ea5e4619dc3d83c3b001417"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/8mJOf0Y2ZhS89MYye9MM3olmUFP.jpg","id":"4ea5e4619dc3d83c3b001417"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/8mJOf0Y2ZhS89MYye9MM3olmUFP.jpg","id":"4ea5e4619dc3d83c3b001417"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Richard Attenborough","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":4786,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/4786","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/cBkOCQg6sps2WGABMdtXHPCEPts.jpg"},{"name":"Michael Bennett","job":"Musical","department":"Writing","character":"","id":19246,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19246","profile":""},{"name":"Nicholas Dante","job":"Musical","department":"Writing","character":"","id":19247,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19247","profile":""},{"name":"James Kirkwood Jr.","job":"Musical","department":"Writing","character":"","id":19248,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19248","profile":""},{"name":"Arnold Schulman","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":19249,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19249","profile":""},{"name":"Cy Feuer","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":19250,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19250","profile":""},{"name":"Ernest H.
