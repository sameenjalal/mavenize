When he arrives in Stockholm for the award ceremony, he is delighted to find that the Swedish Foreign Department has sent the beautiful Inger Lisa Andersson (Elke Sommer) as his personal chaperone. When Craig arrives at his hotel, he is introduced to another laureate, Dr. Max Stratman (Edward G. Robinson), a famous German-American physicist, who is accompanied by his niece Emily (Diane Baker).","keywords":["nobel prize","doppelgängerin","nobel prize laureate"],"released":"1963-12-25","runtime":134,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ4TVr_FVTg","genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/thriller","name":"Thriller","id":53}],"studios":[{"name":"Roxbury Productions","id":1545,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/1545-roxbury-productions"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":140,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/h8OLRRpQY8qEJgbmbyoKOBqtOjj.jpg","id":"4ea5ea1f34f8633bdc001fab"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":234,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/h8OLRRpQY8qEJgbmbyoKOBqtOjj.jpg","id":"4ea5ea1f34f8633bdc001fab"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":281,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/h8OLRRpQY8qEJgbmbyoKOBqtOjj.jpg","id":"4ea5ea1f34f8633bdc001fab"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":520,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/h8OLRRpQY8qEJgbmbyoKOBqtOjj.jpg","id":"4ea5ea1f34f8633bdc001fab"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":760,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/h8OLRRpQY8qEJgbmbyoKOBqtOjj.jpg","id":"4ea5ea1f34f8633bdc001fab"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1855,"width":1220,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/h8OLRRpQY8qEJgbmbyoKOBqtOjj.jpg","id":"4ea5ea1f34f8633bdc001fab"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/fOWoKtXiRmKSTfqFhe9RzEhHMsR.jpg","id":"4ee602fd7b9aa15d1700092d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/fOWoKtXiRmKSTfqFhe9RzEhHMsR.jpg","id":"4ee602fd7b9aa15d1700092d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/fOWoKtXiRmKSTfqFhe9RzEhHMsR.jpg","id":"4ee602fd7b9aa15d1700092d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/fOWoKtXiRmKSTfqFhe9RzEhHMsR.jpg","id":"4ee602fd7b9aa15d1700092d"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Mark Robson","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":19457,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/19457","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wpgcWNYUGpMx8kRIM9b9skvB6ov.jpg"},{"name":"Ernest Lehman","job":"Author","department":"Writing","character":"","id":2637,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/2637","profile":""},{"name":"Jerry Goldsmith","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":1760,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/1760","profile":""},{"name":"Irving Wallace","job":"Novel","department":"Writing","character":"","id":35153,"order":0,"cast_id":15,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/35153","profile":""},{"name":"Pandro S.
