The city is called Yentown, and it is much like Tokyo. Sixteen-year-old Ageha (Ito), a young girl whose mother has just died, is passed on from person to person until a prostitute named Glico (Chara) finally takes pity on her.Under Glico's care, Ageha has many experiences with the other poverty-stricken immigrants in Yentown. Eventually, due to a sudden twist in fate, the immigrants are given a chance to realize their dreams. But in doing so, they destroy their solidarity, and have to face their problems separately.","keywords":["illegale prostitution","tokyo","prostitute","money laundering","geld","falschgeld"],"released":"1996-01-01","runtime":146,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/crime","name":"Crime","id":80}],"studios":[{"name":"Rockwell Eyes","id":2487,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/company/2487-rockwell-eyes"}],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"ja","name":"Japanese","native_name":"日本語"}],"countries":[{"code":"JP","name":"Japan","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/jp"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/cXaqYAp2HvaoT464WHMLTghe9BH.jpg","id":"4ea5fed49dc3d83c3b00256d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/cXaqYAp2HvaoT464WHMLTghe9BH.jpg","id":"4ea5fed49dc3d83c3b00256d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/cXaqYAp2HvaoT464WHMLTghe9BH.jpg","id":"4ea5fed49dc3d83c3b00256d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":479,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/cXaqYAp2HvaoT464WHMLTghe9BH.jpg","id":"4ea5fed49dc3d83c3b00256d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":700,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/cXaqYAp2HvaoT464WHMLTghe9BH.jpg","id":"4ea5fed49dc3d83c3b00256d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":980,"width":700,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/cXaqYAp2HvaoT464WHMLTghe9BH.jpg","id":"4ea5fed49dc3d83c3b00256d"}}],"backdrops":[],"cast":[{"name":"Chara","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Glico","id":55782,"order":1,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55782","profile":""},{"name":"Hiroshi Mikami","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Feihong","id":55783,"order":2,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55783","profile":""},{"name":"Yosuke Eguchi","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Ryou Ryank","id":55784,"order":3,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55784","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wtNjvKT5GqTYKXnqYa8C8vL7BEx.jpg"},{"name":"Ayumi Ito","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Ageha","id":9707,"order":4,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/9707","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/eqbLqppPaH5PuCZ02gXlhlLszse.jpg"},{"name":"Shunji Iwai","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":55785,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55785","profile":""},{"name":"Takeshi Kobayashi","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":55786,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55786","profile":""},{"name":"Noboru Shinoda","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":55787,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/55787","profile":""},{"name":"Yohei Taneda","job":"Production Design","department":"Art","character":"","id":6444,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/6444","profile":""}],"belongs_to_collection":null,"version":267,"last_modified_at":"2012-05-14 16:40:50 UTC"}]
