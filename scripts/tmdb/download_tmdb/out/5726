It was Meyer's first color film following a string of black & white \"roughie nudies\", including Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! While a straightforward sexploitation film, the film owes some debt to the French new wave and cinéma vérité traditions, and is known to some under the titles: 'Mondo Girls' and 'Mondo Top.'Its tagline: \"Two Much For One Man...Russ Meyer's Busty Buxotic Beauties ... Titilating ... Torrid ... Untopable ... Too Much For One Man!\"The film was banned in Finland.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondo_Topless","keywords":["female nudity","san
