John, her husband, is an aid-worker in Eastern Europe. He has been gone many months. Helen is desperately anxious that he should come home. Taking the kids to school one morning, she is killed in a car accident. She remains caught in limbo, trapped between life and death. Many miles away, in war-torn Eastern Europe, John is unaware that his wife has died. As Helen herself is unaware that she is dead. Thus begins, a four-day Odyssey: Grandpa and the kids must come to terms with Helen's death; John must travel across a war-torn land as he tries to reach home; and Helen must stand helplessly observing her own existence as it comes back to haunt her - until at last she is reconciled with John, and thus released.","keywords":["london"],"released":"2003-12-12","runtime":100,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/drama","name":"Drama","id":18}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"FR","name":"France","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/fr"},{"code":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/gb"},{"code":"US","name":"United States of America","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/country/us"}],"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":142,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/Y6h7o9avrTqwYJg6IwJzhgHEdb.jpg","id":"4ea5f02a34f8633bdc0023f1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":237,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/Y6h7o9avrTqwYJg6IwJzhgHEdb.jpg","id":"4ea5f02a34f8633bdc0023f1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":285,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/Y6h7o9avrTqwYJg6IwJzhgHEdb.jpg","id":"4ea5f02a34f8633bdc0023f1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":526,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/Y6h7o9avrTqwYJg6IwJzhgHEdb.jpg","id":"4ea5f02a34f8633bdc0023f1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":770,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/Y6h7o9avrTqwYJg6IwJzhgHEdb.jpg","id":"4ea5f02a34f8633bdc0023f1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1025,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/Y6h7o9avrTqwYJg6IwJzhgHEdb.jpg","id":"4ea5f02a34f8633bdc0023f1"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/qvMsP0KuguQjrLNoNTti4rYi8Vj.jpg","id":"4ea5f02d34f8633bdc0023f3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/qvMsP0KuguQjrLNoNTti4rYi8Vj.jpg","id":"4ea5f02d34f8633bdc0023f3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/qvMsP0KuguQjrLNoNTti4rYi8Vj.jpg","id":"4ea5f02d34f8633bdc0023f3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/qvMsP0KuguQjrLNoNTti4rYi8Vj.jpg","id":"4ea5f02d34f8633bdc0023f3"}}],"cast":[{"name":"Emily Young","job":"Director","department":"Directing","character":"","id":47201,"order":0,"cast_id":1,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47201","profile":""},{"name":"Emily Young","job":"Screenplay","department":"Writing","character":"","id":47201,"order":0,"cast_id":2,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47201","profile":""},{"name":"Gayle Griffiths","job":"Producer","department":"Production","character":"","id":47202,"order":0,"cast_id":3,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47202","profile":""},{"name":"Murray Gold","job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","character":"","id":47203,"order":0,"cast_id":4,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47203","profile":""},{"name":"Wojciech Szepel","job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","character":"","id":30078,"order":0,"cast_id":5,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/30078","profile":""},{"name":"David Charap","job":"Editor","department":"Editing","character":"","id":47204,"order":0,"cast_id":6,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47204","profile":""},{"name":"Gary Davy","job":"Casting","department":"Production","character":"","id":47205,"order":0,"cast_id":7,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47205","profile":""},{"name":"Ingeborga Dapkunaite","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Helen","id":14593,"order":0,"cast_id":8,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/14593","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1bS8WvHfCPRDBiIDy6fuMFzaP1f.jpg"},{"name":"Peter Mullan","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"John","id":3064,"order":1,"cast_id":9,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/3064","profile":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/s6fVtjCu0HshEIbfLklz4e2OoWS.jpg"},{"name":"Millie Findlay","job":"Actor","department":"Actors","character":"Kate","id":47206,"order":2,"cast_id":10,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/person/47206","profile":""},{"name":"James E.
