At once mythical and heartbreakingly real, this unique film features astonishing performances by its child stars and was honored with a special foreign language film Academy Award in 1952.","keywords":["france","1940s","waisenmädchen","cemetery","second world war","foster parents","funeral","postwar period","dead
