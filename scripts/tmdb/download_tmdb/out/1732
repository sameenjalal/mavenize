Following the story somewhat, friends of the new King Rudolph of Ruritania fear for his life, and switch him with a look-a-like London cabby. Throw in two(!) lovely blondes, treachery, and a battle for life and honour, and enjoy life at its zaniest.","keywords":["london","doppelg√§ngerin","fiaker","brother"],"released":"1979-12-21","runtime":108,"budget":0,"revenue":0,"homepage":"","trailer":null,"genres":[{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/action","name":"Action","id":28},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/adventure","name":"Adventure","id":12},{"type":"genre","url":"http://themoviedb.org/genre/comedy","name":"Comedy","id":35}],"studios":[],"languages_spoken":[{"code":"de","name":"German","native_name":"Deutsch"},{"code":"en","name":"English","native_name":"English"}],"countries":[{"code":"GB","name":"United
