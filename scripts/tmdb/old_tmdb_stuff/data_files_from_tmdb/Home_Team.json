His athletic interests go beyond the playing field and into the gambling dens. Convicted for his addiction, the soccer player is assigned to community service at a children's home as a condition of his parole. The home attempts to exploit his soccer skills by forming a team. Butler takes no interest, though, until the home burns down and the team begins playing for their homes instead of personal pride or a payoff.","released":"1999-11-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/h6cEx6kTvL9NlYvLy0nqG0wC2lR.jpg","id":"4ea6a0a39dc3d83c3b00cc01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/h6cEx6kTvL9NlYvLy0nqG0wC2lR.jpg","id":"4ea6a0a39dc3d83c3b00cc01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/h6cEx6kTvL9NlYvLy0nqG0wC2lR.jpg","id":"4ea6a0a39dc3d83c3b00cc01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/h6cEx6kTvL9NlYvLy0nqG0wC2lR.jpg","id":"4ea6a0a39dc3d83c3b00cc01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/h6cEx6kTvL9NlYvLy0nqG0wC2lR.jpg","id":"4ea6a0a39dc3d83c3b00cc01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":570,"width":380,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/h6cEx6kTvL9NlYvLy0nqG0wC2lR.jpg","id":"4ea6a0a39dc3d83c3b00cc01"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":325,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 21:43:42 UTC"}]
