The reality, of course, is that DON is held captive in a secret location, while his bumpkin of a look-alike, Vijay, is polished and sent to take down DON's gang.In a bizarre twist of fate, when the man shielding the humble and streetwise Vijay, is killed, the latter comes to terms with the horrifying realization that both the police and the gang are out to nab him for different reasons.In a desperate attempt to prove his innocence, he is aided by the glamorously staggering Roma (Priyanka Chopra), and handsomely striking, Jasjit (Arjun Rampal), who owes Vijay a favor for care-taking his son during his imprisonment. But will Vijay be successful in his mission?","released":"2006-10-20","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/qBprIi1YndwBM6TxTfeHlohC9gU.jpg","id":"4ea63b549dc3d83c3b005c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/qBprIi1YndwBM6TxTfeHlohC9gU.jpg","id":"4ea63b549dc3d83c3b005c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/qBprIi1YndwBM6TxTfeHlohC9gU.jpg","id":"4ea63b549dc3d83c3b005c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/qBprIi1YndwBM6TxTfeHlohC9gU.jpg","id":"4ea63b549dc3d83c3b005c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/qBprIi1YndwBM6TxTfeHlohC9gU.jpg","id":"4ea63b549dc3d83c3b005c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/qBprIi1YndwBM6TxTfeHlohC9gU.jpg","id":"4ea63b549dc3d83c3b005c61"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/wxTpIJn375p8NRSxygS1Dz9UZv.jpg","id":"4ea63b569dc3d83c3b005c63"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/wxTpIJn375p8NRSxygS1Dz9UZv.jpg","id":"4ea63b569dc3d83c3b005c63"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/wxTpIJn375p8NRSxygS1Dz9UZv.jpg","id":"4ea63b569dc3d83c3b005c63"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/wxTpIJn375p8NRSxygS1Dz9UZv.jpg","id":"4ea63b569dc3d83c3b005c63"}}],"version":485,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-21 14:40:28 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Don","name":"Don","alternative_name":"DON","movie_type":"movie","id":33104,"imdb_id":"tt0077451","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/33104","votes":2,"rating":8.5,"certification":"","overview":"A ruthless gangster named Don is killed during a scuffle with the police.
