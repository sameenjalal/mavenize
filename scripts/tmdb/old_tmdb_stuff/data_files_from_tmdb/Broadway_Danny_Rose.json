It was screened out of competition at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. A hapless talent manager named Danny Rose, by helping a client, gets dragged into a love triangle involving the mob. His story is told in flashback, an anecdote shared amongst a group of comedians over lunch at New York's Carnegie Deli. Rose's one-man talent agency represents countless incompetent entertainers, including a one-legged tap dancer, and one slightly talented one: washed-up lounge singer Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte), whose career is on the rebound.","released":"1984-01-27","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":132,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1BYDJvtE2x8BS0iq0T8yeXvNzeH.jpg","id":"4ea61daf2c058837cb004c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":220,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1BYDJvtE2x8BS0iq0T8yeXvNzeH.jpg","id":"4ea61daf2c058837cb004c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":265,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1BYDJvtE2x8BS0iq0T8yeXvNzeH.jpg","id":"4ea61daf2c058837cb004c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":489,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1BYDJvtE2x8BS0iq0T8yeXvNzeH.jpg","id":"4ea61daf2c058837cb004c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":715,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1BYDJvtE2x8BS0iq0T8yeXvNzeH.jpg","id":"4ea61daf2c058837cb004c61"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":953,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1BYDJvtE2x8BS0iq0T8yeXvNzeH.jpg","id":"4ea61daf2c058837cb004c61"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/oWVlrivklVWzKn4CRszBRrn4mkY.jpg","id":"4ea61dac2c058837cb004c5d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/oWVlrivklVWzKn4CRszBRrn4mkY.jpg","id":"4ea61dac2c058837cb004c5d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/oWVlrivklVWzKn4CRszBRrn4mkY.jpg","id":"4ea61dac2c058837cb004c5d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/oWVlrivklVWzKn4CRszBRrn4mkY.jpg","id":"4ea61dac2c058837cb004c5d"}}],"version":383,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-21 22:47:53 UTC"}]
