She lives comfortably with her family in the suburbs. In other words, Fiona is happy... until one day she accidentally gets locked into a walk-in fridge. She escapes the next morning, half frozen and barely alive, only to realize that her husband and two children didn't even notice she was missing. But when Fiona develops an obsession for everything cold and icy: snow, polar bears, fridges, icebergs--she drops everything, climbs into a frozen goods delivery truck and leaves home. For a real iceberg.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/g9dUOBNmb0HRvsjVnjd3kHBD7C0.jpg","id":"4ea6b99534f8633bdc00ff05"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":205,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/g9dUOBNmb0HRvsjVnjd3kHBD7C0.jpg","id":"4ea6b99534f8633bdc00ff05"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":246,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/g9dUOBNmb0HRvsjVnjd3kHBD7C0.jpg","id":"4ea6b99534f8633bdc00ff05"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":455,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/g9dUOBNmb0HRvsjVnjd3kHBD7C0.jpg","id":"4ea6b99534f8633bdc00ff05"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":666,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/g9dUOBNmb0HRvsjVnjd3kHBD7C0.jpg","id":"4ea6b99534f8633bdc00ff05"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":887,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/g9dUOBNmb0HRvsjVnjd3kHBD7C0.jpg","id":"4ea6b99534f8633bdc00ff05"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":37,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 09:12:39 UTC"}]
