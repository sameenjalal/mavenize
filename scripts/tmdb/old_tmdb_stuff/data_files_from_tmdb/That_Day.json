Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary, Summer (Deschanel), Tom discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love the Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Tom is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Tom believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance.

This presents particular challenges as the vampires' food supply - human blood - is dwindling and rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire society's needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.","released":"2009-10-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/3QWn8pIUN96LT4uzRVLPyu6pv8X.jpg","id":"4f1f5f3119c29579d5000c6e"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/3QWn8pIUN96LT4uzRVLPyu6pv8X.jpg","id":"4f1f5f3119c29579d5000c6e"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/3QWn8pIUN96LT4uzRVLPyu6pv8X.jpg","id":"4f1f5f3119c29579d5000c6e"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/3QWn8pIUN96LT4uzRVLPyu6pv8X.jpg","id":"4f1f5f3119c29579d5000c6e"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/3QWn8pIUN96LT4uzRVLPyu6pv8X.jpg","id":"4f1f5f3119c29579d5000c6e"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2250,"width":1500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/3QWn8pIUN96LT4uzRVLPyu6pv8X.jpg","id":"4f1f5f3119c29579d5000c6e"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/2oJboZn3EXCO9ka9DiNyoFp65SR.jpg","id":"4ea643c39dc3d83c3b0064a7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/2oJboZn3EXCO9ka9DiNyoFp65SR.jpg","id":"4ea643c39dc3d83c3b0064a7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/2oJboZn3EXCO9ka9DiNyoFp65SR.jpg","id":"4ea643c39dc3d83c3b0064a7"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/2oJboZn3EXCO9ka9DiNyoFp65SR.jpg","id":"4ea643c39dc3d83c3b0064a7"}}],"version":1342,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 18:42:07 UTC"},{"score":0.73949784,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Independence Day","name":"Independence Day","alternative_name":"ID4","movie_type":"movie","id":602,"imdb_id":"tt0116629","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/602","votes":36,"rating":7.4,"certification":"PG-13","overview":"On July 2, a giant alien mothership enters orbit around Earth and deploys several dozen saucer-shaped \"destroyer\" spacecraft that quickly lay waste to major cities around the planet.
