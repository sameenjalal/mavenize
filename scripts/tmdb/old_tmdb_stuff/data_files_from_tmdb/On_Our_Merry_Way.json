Martha suggests, \"Has a little child ever changed your life?\" Oliver gets answers from two slow-talking musicians, an actress whose roles usually feature a sarong, and an itinerant cardsharp. In each case the \"little child\" is hardly innocent: in the first, a local auto mechanic's \"baby\" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician; in the second, a spoiled child star learns kindness; in the third, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. And Oliver, what becomes of him?","released":"1948-02-03","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":142,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/s0lEWmNLUX5s8hhwCpbXQVvHm2i.jpg","id":"4f443d4a19c2957d3c005f54"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":237,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/s0lEWmNLUX5s8hhwCpbXQVvHm2i.jpg","id":"4f443d4a19c2957d3c005f54"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":285,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/s0lEWmNLUX5s8hhwCpbXQVvHm2i.jpg","id":"4f443d4a19c2957d3c005f54"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":527,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/s0lEWmNLUX5s8hhwCpbXQVvHm2i.jpg","id":"4f443d4a19c2957d3c005f54"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":770,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/s0lEWmNLUX5s8hhwCpbXQVvHm2i.jpg","id":"4f443d4a19c2957d3c005f54"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":616,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/s0lEWmNLUX5s8hhwCpbXQVvHm2i.jpg","id":"4f443d4a19c2957d3c005f54"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 08:51:34 UTC"}]
