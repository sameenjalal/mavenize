In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight to the last man. \"Downfall\" explores these final days of the Reich, where senior German leaders (such as Himmler and Goring) began defecting from their beloved Fuhrer, in an effort to save their own lives, while still others (Joseph Goebbels) pledge to die with Hitler. Hitler, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and Hitler lies dead by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.","released":"2004-09-08","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/Ah8vCf2Jpz3ZbXp9mT5tBGWqgg1.jpg","id":"4ea5e903a34d4b3d2d00014d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/Ah8vCf2Jpz3ZbXp9mT5tBGWqgg1.jpg","id":"4ea5e903a34d4b3d2d00014d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/Ah8vCf2Jpz3ZbXp9mT5tBGWqgg1.jpg","id":"4ea5e903a34d4b3d2d00014d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/Ah8vCf2Jpz3ZbXp9mT5tBGWqgg1.jpg","id":"4ea5e903a34d4b3d2d00014d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/Ah8vCf2Jpz3ZbXp9mT5tBGWqgg1.jpg","id":"4ea5e903a34d4b3d2d00014d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2280,"width":1520,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/Ah8vCf2Jpz3ZbXp9mT5tBGWqgg1.jpg","id":"4ea5e903a34d4b3d2d00014d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/d3AmCJXvsP818di5KcCj4fNi36.jpg","id":"4ea5e8e0a34d4b3d2d000137"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/d3AmCJXvsP818di5KcCj4fNi36.jpg","id":"4ea5e8e0a34d4b3d2d000137"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/d3AmCJXvsP818di5KcCj4fNi36.jpg","id":"4ea5e8e0a34d4b3d2d000137"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/d3AmCJXvsP818di5KcCj4fNi36.jpg","id":"4ea5e8e0a34d4b3d2d000137"}}],"version":609,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 19:46:57 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Unknown","name":"Unknown","alternative_name":"Unknown White Male","movie_type":"movie","id":48138,"imdb_id":"tt1401152","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/48138","votes":20,"rating":8.3,"certification":"PG-13","overview":"A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him.
