His goal is simple: forming an army of giant henchmen and ruling over the universe. Meanwhile, Arthur is still a Minimoy, and thus in a state where he's unable to fend him off. With the help of Selenia and Betameche, he hatches a plan to regain his usual size: all they must do is infiltrate Arthur's house through the pipeworks, catch an electric train from his bedroom to his grandfather's study and find an elixir that will make him grow back to his human size. Sounds simple enough, if it weren't for Darkos, Maltazard's own son, hot on their tails.","released":"2010-08-22","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":132,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/jiPZYBDWDDVipvM9ji1552OFVyF.jpg","id":"4f26ac1f760ee363fe000f01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":220,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/jiPZYBDWDDVipvM9ji1552OFVyF.jpg","id":"4f26ac1f760ee363fe000f01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":265,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/jiPZYBDWDDVipvM9ji1552OFVyF.jpg","id":"4f26ac1f760ee363fe000f01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":490,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/jiPZYBDWDDVipvM9ji1552OFVyF.jpg","id":"4f26ac1f760ee363fe000f01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":716,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/jiPZYBDWDDVipvM9ji1552OFVyF.jpg","id":"4f26ac1f760ee363fe000f01"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":4000,"width":2794,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/jiPZYBDWDDVipvM9ji1552OFVyF.jpg","id":"4f26ac1f760ee363fe000f01"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/hJ7zcIAxY3cfavFmsfz2JetRQ1x.jpg","id":"4ec655ec5e73d66316000f9e"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/hJ7zcIAxY3cfavFmsfz2JetRQ1x.jpg","id":"4ec655ec5e73d66316000f9e"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/hJ7zcIAxY3cfavFmsfz2JetRQ1x.jpg","id":"4ec655ec5e73d66316000f9e"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/hJ7zcIAxY3cfavFmsfz2JetRQ1x.jpg","id":"4ec655ec5e73d66316000f9e"}}],"version":291,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 09:53:23 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Sherlock Holmes","name":"Sherlock Holmes","alternative_name":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes","movie_type":"movie","id":33555,"imdb_id":"tt1522835","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/33555","votes":1,"rating":0.5,"certification":"","overview":"Sherlock Holmes and Watson are on the trail of a criminal and scientific mastermind who seems to control monsters and creations which defy belief.","released":"2010-01-26","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/yVeRjNrFPNHkjV200Ncmldd6p6p.jpg","id":"4ea66bc834f8633bdc00921d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/yVeRjNrFPNHkjV200Ncmldd6p6p.jpg","id":"4ea66bc834f8633bdc00921d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/yVeRjNrFPNHkjV200Ncmldd6p6p.jpg","id":"4ea66bc834f8633bdc00921d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/yVeRjNrFPNHkjV200Ncmldd6p6p.jpg","id":"4ea66bc834f8633bdc00921d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":705,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/yVeRjNrFPNHkjV200Ncmldd6p6p.jpg","id":"4ea66bc834f8633bdc00921d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":939,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/yVeRjNrFPNHkjV200Ncmldd6p6p.jpg","id":"4ea66bc834f8633bdc00921d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/nydyVLoIReyT3ZP223dvIyeLDg2.jpg","id":"4ea66bd034f8633bdc009229"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/nydyVLoIReyT3ZP223dvIyeLDg2.jpg","id":"4ea66bd034f8633bdc009229"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/nydyVLoIReyT3ZP223dvIyeLDg2.jpg","id":"4ea66bd034f8633bdc009229"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/nydyVLoIReyT3ZP223dvIyeLDg2.jpg","id":"4ea66bd034f8633bdc009229"}}],"version":134,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 22:25:29 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","name":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","alternative_name":"Ein Yankee aus Connecticut an König Arthurs Hof","movie_type":"movie","id":36848,"imdb_id":"tt0041259","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/36848","votes":0,"rating":6.5,"certification":"G","overview":"Hank Martin (Bing Crosby), an American mechanic, is knocked out and wakes up in the land of King Arthur.

This canine quest leads Arthur and Buster across Elwood city, deep into the bowels of an ice cream factory, past a giant cow on ice skates, and right up to the point where all hope seems lost.
