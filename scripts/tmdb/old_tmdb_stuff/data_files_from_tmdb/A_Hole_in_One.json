Becca, an executive-turned-stay-at-home mother, tries to redefine her existence in a surreal landscape of well-meaning family and friends. Painful, poignant, and often funny, Becca's experiences lead her to find solace in a mysterious relationship with a troubled young comic-book artist, Jason - the teenage driver of the car that killed Danny. Becca's fixation with Jason pulls her away from memories of Danny, while Howie immerses himself in the past, seeking refuge in outsiders who offer him something Becca is unable to give. The Corbetts, both adrift, make surprising and dangerous choices as they choose a path that will determine their fate.","released":"2010-10-27","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/bdvP1cX4lgD40DBgVHhj5lm5vDO.jpg","id":"4ea65de834f8633bdc008149"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/bdvP1cX4lgD40DBgVHhj5lm5vDO.jpg","id":"4ea65de834f8633bdc008149"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/bdvP1cX4lgD40DBgVHhj5lm5vDO.jpg","id":"4ea65de834f8633bdc008149"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":507,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/bdvP1cX4lgD40DBgVHhj5lm5vDO.jpg","id":"4ea65de834f8633bdc008149"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":741,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/bdvP1cX4lgD40DBgVHhj5lm5vDO.jpg","id":"4ea65de834f8633bdc008149"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1012,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/bdvP1cX4lgD40DBgVHhj5lm5vDO.jpg","id":"4ea65de834f8633bdc008149"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/mXKwU2ucrjMzKP2tC7ITrPp4WPz.jpg","id":"4ea65dea34f8633bdc00814b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/mXKwU2ucrjMzKP2tC7ITrPp4WPz.jpg","id":"4ea65dea34f8633bdc00814b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/mXKwU2ucrjMzKP2tC7ITrPp4WPz.jpg","id":"4ea65dea34f8633bdc00814b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mXKwU2ucrjMzKP2tC7ITrPp4WPz.jpg","id":"4ea65dea34f8633bdc00814b"}}],"version":1046,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 09:37:08 UTC"},{"score":2.38789,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Hole","name":"The Hole","alternative_name":"The Hole","movie_type":"movie","id":467,"imdb_id":"tt0242527","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/467","votes":2,"rating":5.0,"certification":"R","overview":"The Hole is a psycho-thriller about the story of the death of three teenagers in a bunker filmed from the perspective of the one that survived from the group.","released":"2001-04-20","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/xX00zQi6BSbJb1eoc905eoz8Mde.jpg","id":"4ea5d62d2c058837cb00085f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/xX00zQi6BSbJb1eoc905eoz8Mde.jpg","id":"4ea5d62d2c058837cb00085f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/xX00zQi6BSbJb1eoc905eoz8Mde.jpg","id":"4ea5d62d2c058837cb00085f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/xX00zQi6BSbJb1eoc905eoz8Mde.jpg","id":"4ea5d62d2c058837cb00085f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/xX00zQi6BSbJb1eoc905eoz8Mde.jpg","id":"4ea5d62d2c058837cb00085f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/xX00zQi6BSbJb1eoc905eoz8Mde.jpg","id":"4ea5d62d2c058837cb00085f"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/3M3WOC7SVvJThD7ao9I34iDOiqO.jpg","id":"4ea5d6282c058837cb00085b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/3M3WOC7SVvJThD7ao9I34iDOiqO.jpg","id":"4ea5d6282c058837cb00085b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/3M3WOC7SVvJThD7ao9I34iDOiqO.jpg","id":"4ea5d6282c058837cb00085b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/3M3WOC7SVvJThD7ao9I34iDOiqO.jpg","id":"4ea5d6282c058837cb00085b"}}],"version":309,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-24 01:18:24 UTC"},{"score":3.3769865,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Holes","name":"Holes","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":8326,"imdb_id":"tt0311289","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/8326","votes":2,"rating":7.0,"certification":"PG","overview":"‘Holes’ is a 2003 film based on the novel of the same title by Louis Sachar.
