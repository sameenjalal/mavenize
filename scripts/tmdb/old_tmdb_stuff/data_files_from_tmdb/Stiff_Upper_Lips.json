Although it specifically targets A Room with a View, Chariots of Fire, Maurice, A Passage to India, and many other films, in a more general way Stiff Upper Lips satirises popular perceptions of certain Edwardian traits: propriety, sexual repression, xenophobia, and class snobbery.","released":"1999-07-02","posters":[],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 17:42:08 UTC"}]
