Come morning, a posse arrives, forms up along the ridge, and takes for granted that everyone down below is guilty--fit for either shooting to bits or hanging from a tree, whichever comes first. Precisely half of Ride in the Whirlwind's 82 minutes is devoted to tapping the matter-of-fact, absurdist horror of that situation. In the remaining half, the two surviving cowpokes (Jack Nicholson and Cameron Mitchell) seek shelter at a farmhouse where they reluctantly threaten the farmer, accept breakfast from his wife, flirt with his daughter (Millie Perkins), play some checkers, and hope to remain undetected till nightfall.","released":"1965-03-18","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/5UL2D3yRQOqWn3oF102OFLlyNyx.jpg","id":"4ea6a63534f8633bdc00defd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/5UL2D3yRQOqWn3oF102OFLlyNyx.jpg","id":"4ea6a63534f8633bdc00defd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/5UL2D3yRQOqWn3oF102OFLlyNyx.jpg","id":"4ea6a63534f8633bdc00defd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":514,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/5UL2D3yRQOqWn3oF102OFLlyNyx.jpg","id":"4ea6a63534f8633bdc00defd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":751,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/5UL2D3yRQOqWn3oF102OFLlyNyx.jpg","id":"4ea6a63534f8633bdc00defd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":871,"width":580,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/5UL2D3yRQOqWn3oF102OFLlyNyx.jpg","id":"4ea6a63534f8633bdc00defd"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":181,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 15:52:51 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Little Whirlwind","name":"The Little Whirlwind","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":67592,"imdb_id":"tt0033838","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/67592","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"Mickey wants some of the cake Minnie has just baked, so he offers to clean up her yard.
