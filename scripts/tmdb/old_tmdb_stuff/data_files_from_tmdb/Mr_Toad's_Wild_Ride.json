This fantastic roller-coaster ride of hilarious adventures was both written and directed by Terry Jones, who also plays the central role of Mr. Toad. Alongside three former Pythons are a gallery of well-known faces all bringing wit and wonder to a feast of colourful characters. An absolutely charming film to delight children and adults alike, The Wind in the Willows is a perfect updating of Kenneth Grahame’s well-loved children’s classic.","released":"1996-10-18","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/s7gwkSUBIQwvnD991WMEdKBrPHz.jpg","id":"4ee4790f5e73d66f540017e7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/s7gwkSUBIQwvnD991WMEdKBrPHz.jpg","id":"4ee4790f5e73d66f540017e7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":260,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/s7gwkSUBIQwvnD991WMEdKBrPHz.jpg","id":"4ee4790f5e73d66f540017e7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":481,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/s7gwkSUBIQwvnD991WMEdKBrPHz.jpg","id":"4ee4790f5e73d66f540017e7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":703,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/s7gwkSUBIQwvnD991WMEdKBrPHz.jpg","id":"4ee4790f5e73d66f540017e7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":942,"width":670,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/s7gwkSUBIQwvnD991WMEdKBrPHz.jpg","id":"4ee4790f5e73d66f540017e7"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":164,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/ceHa6yXH6v7ZB9YFHYiHx0DOW7P.jpg","id":"4ea7105f34f863633c0036df"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":425,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/ceHa6yXH6v7ZB9YFHYiHx0DOW7P.jpg","id":"4ea7105f34f863633c0036df"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":698,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/ceHa6yXH6v7ZB9YFHYiHx0DOW7P.jpg","id":"4ea7105f34f863633c0036df"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":698,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/ceHa6yXH6v7ZB9YFHYiHx0DOW7P.jpg","id":"4ea7105f34f863633c0036df"}}],"version":237,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 13:42:49 UTC"}]
