How can he muster the strength to stand against the odds? How can he learn kung-fu, steal a car, score some weed, AND finally get with that doped-up trick Sunny Funny? HE'S GOTTA BELIEVE!!! Inspired by the game Parappa the Rapper for PS1 (and borrowing bits from 8 Mile), Nth Mile is a tribute to the great, simple story of a puppy who raps his way into a flower's heart. Of course, along the way he has to fight evil money husslers, learn bling powers from 4 rap masters, and eventually face off against his various nemeses in a furious climactic rap battle that will blow the roof clear off of Club Fun!","released":null,"posters":[],"backdrops":[],"version":26,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 19:27:28 UTC"}]
