It is in just the right spot for a much needed rest stop on the local stagecoach line, and Hogue uses this to his advantage. He builds a house and makes money off the stagecoach passengers. Hildy, a whore from the nearest town, moves in with him. Hogue has everything going his way until the advent of the automobile ends the era of the stagecoach.","released":"1970-05-13","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/jdkl4L65r5KLkWNHLBiUEbMufZm.jpg","id":"4ea64df934f8633bdc007343"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":205,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/jdkl4L65r5KLkWNHLBiUEbMufZm.jpg","id":"4ea64df934f8633bdc007343"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":247,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/jdkl4L65r5KLkWNHLBiUEbMufZm.jpg","id":"4ea64df934f8633bdc007343"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":456,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/jdkl4L65r5KLkWNHLBiUEbMufZm.jpg","id":"4ea64df934f8633bdc007343"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":667,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/jdkl4L65r5KLkWNHLBiUEbMufZm.jpg","id":"4ea64df934f8633bdc007343"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":888,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/jdkl4L65r5KLkWNHLBiUEbMufZm.jpg","id":"4ea64df934f8633bdc007343"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/h1ZWcFuJ4Lbv29ftZdB3zfEIveP.jpg","id":"4ea64df534f8633bdc00733f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/h1ZWcFuJ4Lbv29ftZdB3zfEIveP.jpg","id":"4ea64df534f8633bdc00733f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/h1ZWcFuJ4Lbv29ftZdB3zfEIveP.jpg","id":"4ea64df534f8633bdc00733f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/h1ZWcFuJ4Lbv29ftZdB3zfEIveP.jpg","id":"4ea64df534f8633bdc00733f"}}],"version":383,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-24 00:15:47 UTC"}]
