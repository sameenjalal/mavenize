The Blues Brothers were an unforgettable part of Saturday Night Live's golden era, making their musical debut in bee costumes singing \"I'm a King Bee,\" and becoming an overnight sensation. Switching to hats and shades inspired by John Lee Hooker, they combined classic Chicago Blues with Stax-Volt R&B to create a sound all their own. Their first album, Briefcase Full of Blues, went double-platinum and led quickly to their hit movie and milestone soundtrack album. The rest is history, and it's all here in a music-filled, memory-blasting account of a band that will always be on a mission from God.","released":"1993-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/7RZlu6guk0aYQwKwWzai42KSA3d.jpg","id":"4ea66bcf2c058837cb00a8ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":219,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/7RZlu6guk0aYQwKwWzai42KSA3d.jpg","id":"4ea66bcf2c058837cb00a8ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":263,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/7RZlu6guk0aYQwKwWzai42KSA3d.jpg","id":"4ea66bcf2c058837cb00a8ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":486,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/7RZlu6guk0aYQwKwWzai42KSA3d.jpg","id":"4ea66bcf2c058837cb00a8ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":710,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/7RZlu6guk0aYQwKwWzai42KSA3d.jpg","id":"4ea66bcf2c058837cb00a8ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":704,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/7RZlu6guk0aYQwKwWzai42KSA3d.jpg","id":"4ea66bcf2c058837cb00a8ad"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":284,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 00:45:24 UTC"}]
