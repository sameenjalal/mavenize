Although she's afraid of him, she doesn't want to give him away because she feels lonely. But Baxter has his own ideas - he longs to be dominated, to be challenged - and so he isn't content with his boring life with the old lady. To get rid of her, he causes an accident. It works, and he's given to the neighbors, a young couple. He's happy... for a while. When they get a baby, he again takes action.","released":"1989-01-18","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":142,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/nRVq58dWeXieVuEttK7lmnsR8DX.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d44f13c137cc00ccbb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":238,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/nRVq58dWeXieVuEttK7lmnsR8DX.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d44f13c137cc00ccbb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":286,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/nRVq58dWeXieVuEttK7lmnsR8DX.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d44f13c137cc00ccbb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":528,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/nRVq58dWeXieVuEttK7lmnsR8DX.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d44f13c137cc00ccbb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":773,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/nRVq58dWeXieVuEttK7lmnsR8DX.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d44f13c137cc00ccbb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1029,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/nRVq58dWeXieVuEttK7lmnsR8DX.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d44f13c137cc00ccbb"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":173,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/5l6WTykCiip8Md72N3CZtcHJ5Va.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d64f13c137cc00ccbd"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":449,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/5l6WTykCiip8Md72N3CZtcHJ5Va.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d64f13c137cc00ccbd"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":736,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/5l6WTykCiip8Md72N3CZtcHJ5Va.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d64f13c137cc00ccbd"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":736,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/5l6WTykCiip8Md72N3CZtcHJ5Va.jpg","id":"4ea6a0d64f13c137cc00ccbd"}}],"version":322,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 18:34:28 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Baxter","name":"The Baxter","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":13169,"imdb_id":"tt0401244","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/13169","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"PG-13","overview":"A man with a \"doormat\" personality tries standing up for himself for a change in this comedy.
