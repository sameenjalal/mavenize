Individually and together, Mastroianni and Andrews (an unlikely team) are magic. He plays a slightly clownish Italian and she, an uptight Britisher. They come together when their spouses run off together. The ending helps redeem this slight film, watchable only because of the great stars.","released":"1991-01-01","posters":[],"backdrops":[],"version":194,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 18:09:57 UTC"}]
