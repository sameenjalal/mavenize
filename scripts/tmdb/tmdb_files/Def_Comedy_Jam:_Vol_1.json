For nearly 10 years, Def Comedy Jam has been a huge hit on TV in the USA (HBO) and now you have a chance to see some of the biggest names in black comedy. And this is the uncut version – too hot for regular TV. See the raw and riotous talents of D.L. Hughley, Adele Givens, GiGeorge, Simply Marvalous, A.J. Jamal and many other new stars in three great, live-recorded shows. And they’re all hosted by the legendary Martin Lawrence (House Party, Bad Boys, Do The Right Thing …), the man who hip-hopped all the way to Hollywood.","released":"2003-09-29","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/6j6N5AFfKNQZyVdPZpV2l6LDy3t.jpg","id":"4ea690c534f8633bdc00c14f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/6j6N5AFfKNQZyVdPZpV2l6LDy3t.jpg","id":"4ea690c534f8633bdc00c14f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/6j6N5AFfKNQZyVdPZpV2l6LDy3t.jpg","id":"4ea690c534f8633bdc00c14f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":483,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6j6N5AFfKNQZyVdPZpV2l6LDy3t.jpg","id":"4ea690c534f8633bdc00c14f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":706,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/6j6N5AFfKNQZyVdPZpV2l6LDy3t.jpg","id":"4ea690c534f8633bdc00c14f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":940,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6j6N5AFfKNQZyVdPZpV2l6LDy3t.jpg","id":"4ea690c534f8633bdc00c14f"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":61,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 17:25:44 UTC"}]
