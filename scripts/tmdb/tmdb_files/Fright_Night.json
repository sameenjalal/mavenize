In fact, he’s so cool he’s even dissing his best friend. But trouble arrives when Jerry moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there’s something not quite right—but everyone, including Charlie’s mom , doesn’t notice. After observing some very strange activity, Charlie comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on the neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone, Charlie has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself in this Craig Gillespie-helmed revamp of the comedy-horror classic.","released":"2011-08-19","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/73kbv2ZgUHxIGcxu1iFEWvwUXZe.jpg","id":"4ed10e3c7b9aa1034b0008ea"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/73kbv2ZgUHxIGcxu1iFEWvwUXZe.jpg","id":"4ed10e3c7b9aa1034b0008ea"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/73kbv2ZgUHxIGcxu1iFEWvwUXZe.jpg","id":"4ed10e3c7b9aa1034b0008ea"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/73kbv2ZgUHxIGcxu1iFEWvwUXZe.jpg","id":"4ed10e3c7b9aa1034b0008ea"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/73kbv2ZgUHxIGcxu1iFEWvwUXZe.jpg","id":"4ed10e3c7b9aa1034b0008ea"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/73kbv2ZgUHxIGcxu1iFEWvwUXZe.jpg","id":"4ed10e3c7b9aa1034b0008ea"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/cFUOvB4PqOkPesKQIPTfdI70sSr.jpg","id":"4ed62e697b9aa110c600013f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/cFUOvB4PqOkPesKQIPTfdI70sSr.jpg","id":"4ed62e697b9aa110c600013f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/cFUOvB4PqOkPesKQIPTfdI70sSr.jpg","id":"4ed62e697b9aa110c600013f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/cFUOvB4PqOkPesKQIPTfdI70sSr.jpg","id":"4ed62e697b9aa110c600013f"}}],"version":1154,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 15:37:01 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Fright Night","name":"Fright Night","alternative_name":"Fright Night - Ammazzavampiri","movie_type":"movie","id":11797,"imdb_id":"tt0089175","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11797","votes":5,"rating":7.6,"certification":"R","overview":"Nobody believes teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) when he discovers that his suave new neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), is a vampire.
