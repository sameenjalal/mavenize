The adventures kick off in \"Angelique\" (aka \"Angelique, Marquise of the Angels,\" 1964), which sends her on a whirlwind ride into a marriage with a wealthy but disfigured count (Robert Hossein, with a gaping latex scar over his cheek), a worldly, learned man whose embrace of science lands him on trial for sorcery. Jean Rochefort is great fun as the brutally blunt lawyer who takes on the king and the church to defend the count. It's overripe melodrama with an overtone of camp, a comically lush score, and plenty of heaving décolletage from
