In the tragic version of what happens next, the beautiful intruder is a disturbed woman who got bored with her Midwestern doctor-husband and dumped him for a photographer. Her husband took the children away and she spiraled into a suicidal depression that landed her straight-jacketed in a mental ward. In the comic version, Melinda is childless and a downstairs neighbor to the dinner hosts, who are ambitious Indy filmmaker Susan and under-employed actor Hobie. Back and forth the stories go, contrasting the destinies of the two Melindas.","released":"2004-10-29","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vcZFFlqpF209ah3yzMWllxbYPTj.jpg","id":"4ea62088a34d4b41fd00179f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":215,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vcZFFlqpF209ah3yzMWllxbYPTj.jpg","id":"4ea62088a34d4b41fd00179f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vcZFFlqpF209ah3yzMWllxbYPTj.jpg","id":"4ea62088a34d4b41fd00179f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":479,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vcZFFlqpF209ah3yzMWllxbYPTj.jpg","id":"4ea62088a34d4b41fd00179f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":700,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vcZFFlqpF209ah3yzMWllxbYPTj.jpg","id":"4ea62088a34d4b41fd00179f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":999,"width":714,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vcZFFlqpF209ah3yzMWllxbYPTj.jpg","id":"4ea62088a34d4b41fd00179f"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/yzR7CE6VEs3ZbvgqyZeq4OKK7Hb.jpg","id":"4ea6207fa34d4b41fd001797"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/yzR7CE6VEs3ZbvgqyZeq4OKK7Hb.jpg","id":"4ea6207fa34d4b41fd001797"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/yzR7CE6VEs3ZbvgqyZeq4OKK7Hb.jpg","id":"4ea6207fa34d4b41fd001797"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/yzR7CE6VEs3ZbvgqyZeq4OKK7Hb.jpg","id":"4ea6207fa34d4b41fd001797"}}],"version":590,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 11:58:05 UTC"}]
