But on this day, at this time, a minor collision will turn two complete strangers into vicious adversaries. Their means of destroying one another might be different, but their goals, ultimately, will be the same: Each will systematically try to dismantle the other's life in a reckless effort to reclaim something he has lost. Late for court, high powered attorney Gavin Banek is weaving through heavy traffic. In a different lane is Doyle Gipson, a father whose right to see his children rests on the decision of a judge with a full docket and no time to spare. On the surface, Banek and Gipson are two very different men: one is struggling away from rock bottom.
