The result, complete with a chorus of gentlemen of Japan as cartoon-like British peers, emphatically underscores the Englishness of the satire. The occasional non sequiturs, like a bunch of gentry dressed for Ascot and singing in Japanese, are loonily fun, and no more absurd than the fantasyland Japan that Gilbert and Sullivan invented. The time frame, though, seems little more than an excuse for a smart black-and-white production design.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg","id":"4ea685d04f13c137cc00a8c5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":218,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg","id":"4ea685d04f13c137cc00a8c5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":262,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg","id":"4ea685d04f13c137cc00a8c5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":484,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg","id":"4ea685d04f13c137cc00a8c5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":708,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg","id":"4ea685d04f13c137cc00a8c5"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":943,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/5Ush72mvbLcGLPQI41Wo0j94F5r.jpg","id":"4ea685d04f13c137cc00a8c5"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":2826,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 23:10:51 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Mikado","name":"The Mikado","alternative_name":"The Town of Titipu","movie_type":"movie","id":61507,"imdb_id":"tt0061973","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/61507","votes":1,"rating":8.0,"certification":"","overview":"In a mythical Japan, Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, has been appointed Lord High Executioner and must find someone to execute before the arrival of the ruling Mikado.
