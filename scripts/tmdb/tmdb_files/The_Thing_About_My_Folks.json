While Ben's wife and his three sisters try to find her, Ben takes Sam on a day trip to see a farmhouse that's for sale. The day trip turns into a road trip while dad and son explore their past, their relationship, and why Sam's wife might have left him. The road trip includes fishing, drinking, playing pool, sleeping under the stars, and frank discussion. Anger simmers close at hand, as do love and hope. Where Sam's wife is - and why she left - leads to the movie's resolution.","released":"2005-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/hoQcGA0TLKjXbIaiYDltIMQ7OS5.jpg","id":"4ea683b1a34d4b4a4f003b39"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/hoQcGA0TLKjXbIaiYDltIMQ7OS5.jpg","id":"4ea683b1a34d4b4a4f003b39"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/hoQcGA0TLKjXbIaiYDltIMQ7OS5.jpg","id":"4ea683b1a34d4b4a4f003b39"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":507,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/hoQcGA0TLKjXbIaiYDltIMQ7OS5.jpg","id":"4ea683b1a34d4b4a4f003b39"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":741,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/hoQcGA0TLKjXbIaiYDltIMQ7OS5.jpg","id":"4ea683b1a34d4b4a4f003b39"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2880,"width":1944,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/hoQcGA0TLKjXbIaiYDltIMQ7OS5.jpg","id":"4ea683b1a34d4b4a4f003b39"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/bYYc6pvOxDo1jDWG6idm4Bfvbyt.jpg","id":"4ea683b3a34d4b4a4f003b3b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/bYYc6pvOxDo1jDWG6idm4Bfvbyt.jpg","id":"4ea683b3a34d4b4a4f003b3b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/bYYc6pvOxDo1jDWG6idm4Bfvbyt.jpg","id":"4ea683b3a34d4b4a4f003b3b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/bYYc6pvOxDo1jDWG6idm4Bfvbyt.jpg","id":"4ea683b3a34d4b4a4f003b3b"}}],"version":278,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 18:49:13 UTC"}]
