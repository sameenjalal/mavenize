Mabley appeared in the film, along with veteran actors Butterfly McQueen and Stepin Fetchit, only a year before her death at the age of 81. The film does not deal with the popular Christian hymn (with words by John Newton) but is a play on Mabley's character, who happens to be named Grace. It has been released on home video.","released":"1974-08-30","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":145,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/84h61uWVdwWH47rvCN73XaAjKsd.jpg","id":"4ea688962c058837cb00ced1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":242,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/84h61uWVdwWH47rvCN73XaAjKsd.jpg","id":"4ea688962c058837cb00ced1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":291,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/84h61uWVdwWH47rvCN73XaAjKsd.jpg","id":"4ea688962c058837cb00ced1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":538,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/84h61uWVdwWH47rvCN73XaAjKsd.jpg","id":"4ea688962c058837cb00ced1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":786,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/84h61uWVdwWH47rvCN73XaAjKsd.jpg","id":"4ea688962c058837cb00ced1"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1069,"width":680,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/84h61uWVdwWH47rvCN73XaAjKsd.jpg","id":"4ea688962c058837cb00ced1"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/ptqM2xXp9sZkRXpS4t2cvvUxiw2.jpg","id":"4ea688972c058837cb00ced3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/ptqM2xXp9sZkRXpS4t2cvvUxiw2.jpg","id":"4ea688972c058837cb00ced3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/ptqM2xXp9sZkRXpS4t2cvvUxiw2.jpg","id":"4ea688972c058837cb00ced3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/ptqM2xXp9sZkRXpS4t2cvvUxiw2.jpg","id":"4ea688972c058837cb00ced3"}}],"version":340,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 16:07:17 UTC"}]
