The gangly, unsure youth is first seen at a baseball game, standing at bat, ready for yet another strike out. Suddenly a terrible earthquake hits; as the others run for safety, the ground opens up under Calvin's boots and he falls through the chasm. He falls and falls until he finds himself landing on the head of a 6th-century black knight. Upon hearing of his miraculous appearance, the elderly King Arthur, seeing him as the savior whose appearance Merlin has predicted, dubs the boy Calvin of Reseda and invites him to dine with the court.","released":"1995-08-11","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":137,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/bKuz5nBThaEQMuu1CanS8jAgjZY.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3f34f863633c001661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":230,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/bKuz5nBThaEQMuu1CanS8jAgjZY.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3f34f863633c001661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":276,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/bKuz5nBThaEQMuu1CanS8jAgjZY.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3f34f863633c001661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":511,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/bKuz5nBThaEQMuu1CanS8jAgjZY.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3f34f863633c001661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":747,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/bKuz5nBThaEQMuu1CanS8jAgjZY.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3f34f863633c001661"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":995,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/bKuz5nBThaEQMuu1CanS8jAgjZY.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3f34f863633c001661"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/8C8g6sMOWGpT2BLiHGHuEZ0PPWt.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3c34f863633c00165d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/8C8g6sMOWGpT2BLiHGHuEZ0PPWt.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3c34f863633c00165d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/8C8g6sMOWGpT2BLiHGHuEZ0PPWt.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3c34f863633c00165d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/8C8g6sMOWGpT2BLiHGHuEZ0PPWt.jpg","id":"4ea6fc3c34f863633c00165d"}}],"version":332,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 08:14:49 UTC"}]
