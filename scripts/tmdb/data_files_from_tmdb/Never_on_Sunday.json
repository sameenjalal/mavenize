The nephew learns of the deal and demands that his uncle s body end up in the cremation oven, falling in love with the funeral owner s daughter in the process. This story about a corpse that cannot find peace, is handled in accordance with the canons of black comedy over which the director displays a skillful mastery, provoking, with the aid of some excellent actors, grotesquely hilarious situations.","released":"2007-02-16","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/jvhx5rxhZ1iuXWC3IeqJLHgDGPv.jpg","id":"4f3620c2760ee312ac000985"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":232,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/jvhx5rxhZ1iuXWC3IeqJLHgDGPv.jpg","id":"4f3620c2760ee312ac000985"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/jvhx5rxhZ1iuXWC3IeqJLHgDGPv.jpg","id":"4f3620c2760ee312ac000985"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":515,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/jvhx5rxhZ1iuXWC3IeqJLHgDGPv.jpg","id":"4f3620c2760ee312ac000985"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":752,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/jvhx5rxhZ1iuXWC3IeqJLHgDGPv.jpg","id":"4f3620c2760ee312ac000985"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":997,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/jvhx5rxhZ1iuXWC3IeqJLHgDGPv.jpg","id":"4f3620c2760ee312ac000985"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 12:45:33 UTC"},{"score":1.1105134,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Pote tin Kyriaki","name":"Never on Sunday","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":43039,"imdb_id":"tt0054198","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/43039","votes":1,"rating":10.0,"certification":"","overview":"Never on Sunday is a 1960 Greek black-and-white film which tells the story of Ilya, a prostitute who lives in the port of Piraeus in Greece, and Homer, an American tourist from Middletown, Connecticut — a classical scholar enamored with all things Greek. Ilya is a character close to the \"hooker with a heart of gold\" cliché. Homer feels Ilya's life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion story.  The film stars Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin, and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including dance, music, and language (through the use of subtitles). The signature song and the bouzouki theme of the movie became hits of the 1960s and brought the composer, Manos Hadjidakis, an Academy Award.","released":"1960-10-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg","id":"4ea68b3d4f13c137cc00b01d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg","id":"4ea68b3d4f13c137cc00b01d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg","id":"4ea68b3d4f13c137cc00b01d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg","id":"4ea68b3d4f13c137cc00b01d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg","id":"4ea68b3d4f13c137cc00b01d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg","id":"4ea68b3d4f13c137cc00b01d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/srwi0HL0xdIi9vaq4lT9dh1nrzM.jpg","id":"4ea68b3f4f13c137cc00b01f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/srwi0HL0xdIi9vaq4lT9dh1nrzM.jpg","id":"4ea68b3f4f13c137cc00b01f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/srwi0HL0xdIi9vaq4lT9dh1nrzM.jpg","id":"4ea68b3f4f13c137cc00b01f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/srwi0HL0xdIi9vaq4lT9dh1nrzM.jpg","id":"4ea68b3f4f13c137cc00b01f"}}],"version":395,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 08:21:05 UTC"}]
