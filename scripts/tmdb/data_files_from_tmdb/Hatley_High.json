Tommy (Nicholas Wright) is a new arrival in his parents' hometown of Hatley, whose mother recently died. He discovers, after the fact, that his mom was once a chess pro and thus a legend in the community. Tommy's chess-fixated peers accept him almost instantly, inferring that he must have inherited his dear mother's skills, but in time Tommy carves out a niche for himself independently of his mom's legacy, and strikes up an enduring romance with Hyacinthe (Rachelle Lefevre) a \"chess cheerleader.\" Two fictional British filmmakers \"frame\" the tale by filming it for a documentary that they are producing, and thus provide witty, ongoing narration.","released":"2003-09-23","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":134,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/fUBAvYROIEpnAv9XabrRjbSEok2.jpg","id":"4ea66b1ea34d4b4a4f0022ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":225,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/fUBAvYROIEpnAv9XabrRjbSEok2.jpg","id":"4ea66b1ea34d4b4a4f0022ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":270,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/fUBAvYROIEpnAv9XabrRjbSEok2.jpg","id":"4ea66b1ea34d4b4a4f0022ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":499,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/fUBAvYROIEpnAv9XabrRjbSEok2.jpg","id":"4ea66b1ea34d4b4a4f0022ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":730,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/fUBAvYROIEpnAv9XabrRjbSEok2.jpg","id":"4ea66b1ea34d4b4a4f0022ad"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":998,"width":684,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/fUBAvYROIEpnAv9XabrRjbSEok2.jpg","id":"4ea66b1ea34d4b4a4f0022ad"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/2b7HWGjPvMRbnAmOWkFHoPtEKV4.jpg","id":"4ea66b20a34d4b4a4f0022af"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/2b7HWGjPvMRbnAmOWkFHoPtEKV4.jpg","id":"4ea66b20a34d4b4a4f0022af"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/2b7HWGjPvMRbnAmOWkFHoPtEKV4.jpg","id":"4ea66b20a34d4b4a4f0022af"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/2b7HWGjPvMRbnAmOWkFHoPtEKV4.jpg","id":"4ea66b20a34d4b4a4f0022af"}}],"version":209,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 18:12:41 UTC"}]
