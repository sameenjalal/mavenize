Buddy's unorthodox approach to therapy is confrontational and abrasive and Dave is bewildered by it. Then, after yet another mishap, Judge Daniels orders Dave to step up his therapy or wind up in jail. So, Buddy moves in with Dave to help him battle his inner demons. Buddy himself has no inner demons since he acts out at every opportunity and that includes making lewd comments about Dave's girlfriend Linda and goading Dave into confronting every slight, past or present, head-on. But Buddy finally goes too far and Dave must decide whether to crawl back into his shell or stand up for himself. Could it be that Buddy's confounding and contradictory treatment is just what the doctor ordered?","released":"2003-03-05","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg","id":"4ea6095b9dc3d83c3b002c6f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg","id":"4ea6095b9dc3d83c3b002c6f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg","id":"4ea6095b9dc3d83c3b002c6f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg","id":"4ea6095b9dc3d83c3b002c6f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg","id":"4ea6095b9dc3d83c3b002c6f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg","id":"4ea6095b9dc3d83c3b002c6f"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/oxngOdJwaKDOwwkQHDTF47GZV4Q.jpg","id":"4ea609589dc3d83c3b002c6d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/oxngOdJwaKDOwwkQHDTF47GZV4Q.jpg","id":"4ea609589dc3d83c3b002c6d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/oxngOdJwaKDOwwkQHDTF47GZV4Q.jpg","id":"4ea609589dc3d83c3b002c6d"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/oxngOdJwaKDOwwkQHDTF47GZV4Q.jpg","id":"4ea609589dc3d83c3b002c6d"}}],"version":697,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 08:45:05 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Eminem: The Anger Management Tour","name":"Eminem: The Anger Management Tour","alternative_name":"Eminem: The Anger Management Tour","movie_type":"movie","id":80265,"imdb_id":"tt0471164","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/80265","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"The inaugural Anger Management Tour was founded and started in the fall 2000 by Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and after the release of The Marshall Mathers LP by Eminem. Originally targeted at both rap and rock fans, the first \"Anger Management\" outing took place in 2000. It had two separate legs. The second tour took place in the summer of 2002. Eminem told LAUNCH, \"It's basically the same thing that it was the last Anger Management Tour without Limp Bizkit...Papa Roach are still cool though.\"[citation needed] The third tour took place in the summer of 2005. 50 Cent missed the tour's first two stops because of a scheduling conflict; he was tied up shooting his film debut. Ludacris filled in on those dates. The European part of the tour was cut short due to the exhaustion of tour founder Eminem and his addiction to sleeping pills.","released":"2005-06-28","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/iGwR2ZHEuabi6pCkLtAtiQqyeKJ.jpg","id":"4ee0d3197b9aa14e110028f2"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/iGwR2ZHEuabi6pCkLtAtiQqyeKJ.jpg","id":"4ee0d3197b9aa14e110028f2"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/iGwR2ZHEuabi6pCkLtAtiQqyeKJ.jpg","id":"4ee0d3197b9aa14e110028f2"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/iGwR2ZHEuabi6pCkLtAtiQqyeKJ.jpg","id":"4ee0d3197b9aa14e110028f2"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":705,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/iGwR2ZHEuabi6pCkLtAtiQqyeKJ.jpg","id":"4ee0d3197b9aa14e110028f2"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1075,"width":762,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/iGwR2ZHEuabi6pCkLtAtiQqyeKJ.jpg","id":"4ee0d3197b9aa14e110028f2"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/kqbCQytCDQ0wWrGQ382S33Ootuf.jpg","id":"4ee0d4a67b9aa14f9f0011e8"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/kqbCQytCDQ0wWrGQ382S33Ootuf.jpg","id":"4ee0d4a67b9aa14f9f0011e8"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/kqbCQytCDQ0wWrGQ382S33Ootuf.jpg","id":"4ee0d4a67b9aa14f9f0011e8"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/kqbCQytCDQ0wWrGQ382S33Ootuf.jpg","id":"4ee0d4a67b9aa14f9f0011e8"}}],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 20:13:47 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Under New Management","name":"Under New Management","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":62399,"imdb_id":"tt0887966","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/62399","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"Sparks and bullets fly when a Wall Street yuppie must steer a Brooklyn mob crew legit before a beautiful FBI agent can build RICO indictments against them.","released":"2009-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/fmjWdbvfMJAm85c6IVfSWcMYjJp.jpg","id":"4ea6b0344f13c137cc00e463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/fmjWdbvfMJAm85c6IVfSWcMYjJp.jpg","id":"4ea6b0344f13c137cc00e463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/fmjWdbvfMJAm85c6IVfSWcMYjJp.jpg","id":"4ea6b0344f13c137cc00e463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/fmjWdbvfMJAm85c6IVfSWcMYjJp.jpg","id":"4ea6b0344f13c137cc00e463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/fmjWdbvfMJAm85c6IVfSWcMYjJp.jpg","id":"4ea6b0344f13c137cc00e463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1800,"width":1200,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/fmjWdbvfMJAm85c6IVfSWcMYjJp.jpg","id":"4ea6b0344f13c137cc00e463"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":92,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 15:25:26 UTC"}]
