The narration ends saying Herbie is now owned by an arrogant Scotsman named Simon Moore III (John Hannah), who abuses and insults Herbie until Herbie comes last in a race, not wanting to obey Simon. Furious, Simon sends Herbie to the junkyard.\nMeanwhile, Hank Cooper (Bruce Campbell), a mechanic in a small garage, is told to enter a race and persuaded to acquire Herbie. The judges are Donny Shotz (Micky Dolenz), a car enthusiast; Alex (Alexandra Wentworth), an old flame of Hank's; and Simon. When Herbie and Hank have won the race, Alex questions Hank, and he gives her a ride, wherein Herbie takes them to an isolated road. Meanwhile, Simon finds the engineer who created Herbie: Dr. Gustav Stumpful (Harold Gould), and requests a second such car: an evil, black edition, whom Simon names Horace.","released":"1997-11-30","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":147,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vjFr1k3eSbKcAiqJqjWndjQnhMe.jpg","id":"4ea6f4af34f863633c000b19"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":247,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vjFr1k3eSbKcAiqJqjWndjQnhMe.jpg","id":"4ea6f4af34f863633c000b19"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":296,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vjFr1k3eSbKcAiqJqjWndjQnhMe.jpg","id":"4ea6f4af34f863633c000b19"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":548,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vjFr1k3eSbKcAiqJqjWndjQnhMe.jpg","id":"4ea6f4af34f863633c000b19"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":801,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vjFr1k3eSbKcAiqJqjWndjQnhMe.jpg","id":"4ea6f4af34f863633c000b19"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1067,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vjFr1k3eSbKcAiqJqjWndjQnhMe.jpg","id":"4ea6f4af34f863633c000b19"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/6FjYOx9YaaBv9QuSVWHuQNYvcBs.jpg","id":"4ea6f4b134f863633c000b1b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/6FjYOx9YaaBv9QuSVWHuQNYvcBs.jpg","id":"4ea6f4b134f863633c000b1b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/6FjYOx9YaaBv9QuSVWHuQNYvcBs.jpg","id":"4ea6f4b134f863633c000b1b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6FjYOx9YaaBv9QuSVWHuQNYvcBs.jpg","id":"4ea6f4b134f863633c000b1b"}}],"version":566,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 08:37:30 UTC"},{"score":1.0189611,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers","name":"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":27033,"imdb_id":"tt0038988","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/27033","votes":2,"rating":9.0,"certification":"","overview":"No overview found.","released":"1946-07-24","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":139,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/6cwhDtvhDvbN0L7dC4o8Oabq9gn.jpg","id":"4ea68e23a34d4b4a4f004755"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":232,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/6cwhDtvhDvbN0L7dC4o8Oabq9gn.jpg","id":"4ea68e23a34d4b4a4f004755"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":279,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/6cwhDtvhDvbN0L7dC4o8Oabq9gn.jpg","id":"4ea68e23a34d4b4a4f004755"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":515,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6cwhDtvhDvbN0L7dC4o8Oabq9gn.jpg","id":"4ea68e23a34d4b4a4f004755"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":753,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/6cwhDtvhDvbN0L7dC4o8Oabq9gn.jpg","id":"4ea68e23a34d4b4a4f004755"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2512,"width":1668,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/6cwhDtvhDvbN0L7dC4o8Oabq9gn.jpg","id":"4ea68e23a34d4b4a4f004755"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/mhw2wNnB149Ssgj9CB4ezXmvZlo.jpg","id":"4ea68e22a34d4b4a4f004753"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/mhw2wNnB149Ssgj9CB4ezXmvZlo.jpg","id":"4ea68e22a34d4b4a4f004753"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/mhw2wNnB149Ssgj9CB4ezXmvZlo.jpg","id":"4ea68e22a34d4b4a4f004753"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mhw2wNnB149Ssgj9CB4ezXmvZlo.jpg","id":"4ea68e22a34d4b4a4f004753"}}],"version":523,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:20:59 UTC"},{"score":1.583569,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Ars amandi","name":"The Art of Love","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":80292,"imdb_id":"tt0085182","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/80292","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":null,"overview":"Young student Claudine has a dream in which the Roman student Cornelius, fascinated by the beautiful wife of the commander, attends lectures on the art of love of great Ovid.
