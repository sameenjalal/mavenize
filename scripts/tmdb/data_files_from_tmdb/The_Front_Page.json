The court press room is full of lame reporters who invent stories as much as write them. All are waiting to cover the hanging of Earl Williams. When Williams escapes from the inept Sheriff, Hildy seizes the opportunity by using his $260 honeymoon money to payoff an insider and get the scoop on the escape. However, Walter Burns, the Post's editor, is slow to repay Hildy back, hoping that he will stay on the story. Getting a major scoop looks possible when Hildy stumbles onto the bewildered escapee and hides him in a roll-top desk in the press room. Burns shows up to help. Can they keep Williams' whereabouts secret long enough to get the scoop, especially with the Sheriff and other reporters hovering around?","released":"1931-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":142,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/7A6WnjT7UI3wfi0mQi2cCBdiVjM.jpg","id":"4ea68acc4f13c137cc00af81"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":237,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/7A6WnjT7UI3wfi0mQi2cCBdiVjM.jpg","id":"4ea68acc4f13c137cc00af81"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":285,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/7A6WnjT7UI3wfi0mQi2cCBdiVjM.jpg","id":"4ea68acc4f13c137cc00af81"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":527,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/7A6WnjT7UI3wfi0mQi2cCBdiVjM.jpg","id":"4ea68acc4f13c137cc00af81"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":771,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/7A6WnjT7UI3wfi0mQi2cCBdiVjM.jpg","id":"4ea68acc4f13c137cc00af81"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":894,"width":580,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/7A6WnjT7UI3wfi0mQi2cCBdiVjM.jpg","id":"4ea68acc4f13c137cc00af81"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":155,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 13:10:11 UTC"}]
