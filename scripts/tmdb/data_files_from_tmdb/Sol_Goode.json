But his luck may have run out; faced with eviction from his hipster apartment, totaling his car, and the threat of having to find a real job, Sol realizes that maybe the life he's been leading is no longer making him happy. Through this self-examination, he finds that being a womanizing hustler is an unfulfilling life and he will truly be happy with his best friend Chloe, who, unfortunately, knows him all too well. The result is a wickedly funny, heart-felt story as Sol tries to win her over.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":137,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/jIOCa2exsyVp6fIdyNGiZzSfBWd.jpg","id":"4ea6ae7f4f13c137cc00e19d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":230,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/jIOCa2exsyVp6fIdyNGiZzSfBWd.jpg","id":"4ea6ae7f4f13c137cc00e19d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":276,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/jIOCa2exsyVp6fIdyNGiZzSfBWd.jpg","id":"4ea6ae7f4f13c137cc00e19d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":510,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/jIOCa2exsyVp6fIdyNGiZzSfBWd.jpg","id":"4ea6ae7f4f13c137cc00e19d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":746,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/jIOCa2exsyVp6fIdyNGiZzSfBWd.jpg","id":"4ea6ae7f4f13c137cc00e19d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":597,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/jIOCa2exsyVp6fIdyNGiZzSfBWd.jpg","id":"4ea6ae7f4f13c137cc00e19d"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":223,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 17:59:00 UTC"}]
