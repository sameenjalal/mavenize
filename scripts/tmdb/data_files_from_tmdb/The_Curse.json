Velma (Hayley Kiyoko) and Shaggy (Nick Palatas) are waiting by the van for Fred (Robbie Amell) and Daphne (Kate Melton) so they can go to meet Daphne's Uncle, who has given them summer jobs at his country club in Erie Point so the gang can pay for the damages they did to a barn (setting it on fire) during one of their mysteries. They then find Fred and Daphne making out in the back of the van. Daphne reveals that Fred saved her life during one of their adventures and that's when she knew he was the one. Velma warns them that often when two people in a group start dating, any changes of that relationship affects the whole group, but the two don't seem to care.","released":"2010-10-16","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/fxLfBw3vCi063pMDbffOzOp2OSw.jpg","id":"4ea710d034f863633c00379d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/fxLfBw3vCi063pMDbffOzOp2OSw.jpg","id":"4ea710d034f863633c00379d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/fxLfBw3vCi063pMDbffOzOp2OSw.jpg","id":"4ea710d034f863633c00379d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/fxLfBw3vCi063pMDbffOzOp2OSw.jpg","id":"4ea710d034f863633c00379d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/fxLfBw3vCi063pMDbffOzOp2OSw.jpg","id":"4ea710d034f863633c00379d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1200,"width":800,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/fxLfBw3vCi063pMDbffOzOp2OSw.jpg","id":"4ea710d034f863633c00379d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/859LyghcvsJf9HQRD7sFl2KeKQ6.jpg","id":"4eb5822b5e73d6531800391c"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/859LyghcvsJf9HQRD7sFl2KeKQ6.jpg","id":"4eb5822b5e73d6531800391c"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/859LyghcvsJf9HQRD7sFl2KeKQ6.jpg","id":"4eb5822b5e73d6531800391c"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/859LyghcvsJf9HQRD7sFl2KeKQ6.jpg","id":"4eb5822b5e73d6531800391c"}}],"version":757,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 05:55:05 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Curse of the Pink Panther","name":"Curse of the Pink Panther","alternative_name":"La Pantera Rosa - Il mistero Clouseau","movie_type":"movie","id":36576,"imdb_id":"tt0085384","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/36576","votes":1,"rating":7.0,"certification":"PG","overview":"Inspector Clouseau disappears, and the Surete wants the world's second best detective to look for him.
