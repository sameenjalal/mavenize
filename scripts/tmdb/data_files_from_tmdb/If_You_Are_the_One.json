The film stars the voice talents of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, Craig Ferguson, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, T.J. Miller, Kristen Wiig, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.The story takes place in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it and instead befriends it. The film was released March 26, 2010,[2] to universally positive reviews. The film overcame a disappointing opening weekend at the box office to become DreamWorks Animation's fifth most successful film in the United States and Canada (behind the Shrek film series)","released":"2010-10-15","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":121,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/3vba81jtWbh03s7m7MwDXhtH55l.jpg","id":"4ea67fca2c058837cb00c31d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":203,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/3vba81jtWbh03s7m7MwDXhtH55l.jpg","id":"4ea67fca2c058837cb00c31d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":244,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/3vba81jtWbh03s7m7MwDXhtH55l.jpg","id":"4ea67fca2c058837cb00c31d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":451,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/3vba81jtWbh03s7m7MwDXhtH55l.jpg","id":"4ea67fca2c058837cb00c31d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":659,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/3vba81jtWbh03s7m7MwDXhtH55l.jpg","id":"4ea67fca2c058837cb00c31d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":956,"width":725,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/3vba81jtWbh03s7m7MwDXhtH55l.jpg","id":"4ea67fca2c058837cb00c31d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/rAQgsFTphc4lYQSMx0eshRX79a.jpg","id":"4ea67fcc2c058837cb00c31f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/rAQgsFTphc4lYQSMx0eshRX79a.jpg","id":"4ea67fcc2c058837cb00c31f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/rAQgsFTphc4lYQSMx0eshRX79a.jpg","id":"4ea67fcc2c058837cb00c31f"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/rAQgsFTphc4lYQSMx0eshRX79a.jpg","id":"4ea67fcc2c058837cb00c31f"}}],"version":449,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 16:41:54 UTC"},{"score":0.9570325,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"P.S.
