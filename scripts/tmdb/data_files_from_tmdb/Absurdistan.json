By the time the mistake comes to light, it emerges that the Turkish family, including the baby, has been deported. The despairing Austrian couple begins a confusing odyssey through Turkey in order to track down the unsuspecting family to their native village. But they are not at all convinced that the babies have been mixed up. It is decided that the only way to know for sure is to have a blood test done. It is decided that the blood work is done in Vienna due to the better medical resources, but that will be far from simple. It will involve an illegal smuggling of the Turks across the Austrian border.","released":"1999-11-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":131,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vjp8fkPADZMzwGO8Y8ZVjqBxmA7.jpg","id":"4ea6a86a34f8633bdc00e2a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":219,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vjp8fkPADZMzwGO8Y8ZVjqBxmA7.jpg","id":"4ea6a86a34f8633bdc00e2a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":263,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vjp8fkPADZMzwGO8Y8ZVjqBxmA7.jpg","id":"4ea6a86a34f8633bdc00e2a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":486,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vjp8fkPADZMzwGO8Y8ZVjqBxmA7.jpg","id":"4ea6a86a34f8633bdc00e2a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":710,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vjp8fkPADZMzwGO8Y8ZVjqBxmA7.jpg","id":"4ea6a86a34f8633bdc00e2a9"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":598,"width":421,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vjp8fkPADZMzwGO8Y8ZVjqBxmA7.jpg","id":"4ea6a86a34f8633bdc00e2a9"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":112,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 10:46:15 UTC"}]
