Six New Yorkers juggle love, friendship, and the keenly challenging specter of adulthood. Sam Wexler is a struggling writer who's having a particularly bad day. When a young boy gets separated from his family on the subway, Sam makes the questionable decision to bring the child back to his apartment and thus begins a rewarding, yet complicated, friendship. Sam's life revolves around his friends-Annie, whose self-image keeps her from commitment; Charlie and Mary Catherine, a couple whose possible move to Los Angeles tests their relationship; and Mississippi, a cabaret singer who catches Sam's eye.","released":"2011-03-04","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/qDwDYXDl3rBqQYIm8rejt0cZmib.jpg","id":"4ea7106b34f863633c0036f3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/qDwDYXDl3rBqQYIm8rejt0cZmib.jpg","id":"4ea7106b34f863633c0036f3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/qDwDYXDl3rBqQYIm8rejt0cZmib.jpg","id":"4ea7106b34f863633c0036f3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/qDwDYXDl3rBqQYIm8rejt0cZmib.jpg","id":"4ea7106b34f863633c0036f3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/qDwDYXDl3rBqQYIm8rejt0cZmib.jpg","id":"4ea7106b34f863633c0036f3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/qDwDYXDl3rBqQYIm8rejt0cZmib.jpg","id":"4ea7106b34f863633c0036f3"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/gdnvcKlZRBgspmqUZrAge13fstQ.jpg","id":"4ea7106c34f863633c0036f5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/gdnvcKlZRBgspmqUZrAge13fstQ.jpg","id":"4ea7106c34f863633c0036f5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/gdnvcKlZRBgspmqUZrAge13fstQ.jpg","id":"4ea7106c34f863633c0036f5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/gdnvcKlZRBgspmqUZrAge13fstQ.jpg","id":"4ea7106c34f863633c0036f5"}}],"version":1301,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 12:24:52 UTC"}]
