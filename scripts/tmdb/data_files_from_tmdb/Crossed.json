In spite of the risk to his own safety and against the advice of those who love him, Litten forced rising political star Adolf Hitler (Hart) to make a sensational appearance in the witness stand of Berlin's central criminal court. Litten aimed to expose the true character of Hitler and his politics to the German public, to reveal his hypocrisy and his violent ambitions, and in doing so, halt the electoral success of the Nazi Party. In a humiliating and hostile cross-examination, Hitler was forced to account for his political beliefs, his contempt for the law and his desire to destroy German democracy. For a brief moment, Hitler's political future was genuinely in the balance.","released":"2011-08-21","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/wE7YIJJOFUOtgBeVStMHPJ82T1G.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb49dc3d83c3b00f691"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/wE7YIJJOFUOtgBeVStMHPJ82T1G.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb49dc3d83c3b00f691"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/wE7YIJJOFUOtgBeVStMHPJ82T1G.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb49dc3d83c3b00f691"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/wE7YIJJOFUOtgBeVStMHPJ82T1G.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb49dc3d83c3b00f691"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/wE7YIJJOFUOtgBeVStMHPJ82T1G.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb49dc3d83c3b00f691"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":986,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/wE7YIJJOFUOtgBeVStMHPJ82T1G.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb49dc3d83c3b00f691"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/4UthMmAWCcQ3gnAkJvP6uLdD5i3.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb59dc3d83c3b00f693"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/4UthMmAWCcQ3gnAkJvP6uLdD5i3.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb59dc3d83c3b00f693"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/4UthMmAWCcQ3gnAkJvP6uLdD5i3.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb59dc3d83c3b00f693"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/4UthMmAWCcQ3gnAkJvP6uLdD5i3.jpg","id":"4ea6bbb59dc3d83c3b00f693"}}],"version":7,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 19:23:58 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Motocrossed","name":"Motocrossed","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":71885,"imdb_id":"tt0273842","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/71885","votes":1,"rating":6.0,"certification":"G","overview":"Motocrossed! is a 2001 Disney Channel Original Movie (based on the Shakespeare play Twelfth Night), about a girl named Andrea Carson who loves motocross, despite the fact that her father finds her unsuited for the sport, being that she is \"just a girl\".
