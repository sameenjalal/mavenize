Kevin (Smith Fort√©) shares space with a male stripper, a girl who dreams of becoming a rock star and an orphaned teenager -- and none of them pay any rent. But after another renter falls to his death in a drunken stupor, Kevin's landlady -- who also happens to be his mother -- threatens to evict him.","released":"1994-01-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/qKsgPKGzU9O9LUvYYedbRnqQ9uq.jpg","id":"4ea6931634f8633bdc00c463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":218,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/qKsgPKGzU9O9LUvYYedbRnqQ9uq.jpg","id":"4ea6931634f8633bdc00c463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":262,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/qKsgPKGzU9O9LUvYYedbRnqQ9uq.jpg","id":"4ea6931634f8633bdc00c463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":484,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/qKsgPKGzU9O9LUvYYedbRnqQ9uq.jpg","id":"4ea6931634f8633bdc00c463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":707,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/qKsgPKGzU9O9LUvYYedbRnqQ9uq.jpg","id":"4ea6931634f8633bdc00c463"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":679,"width":480,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/qKsgPKGzU9O9LUvYYedbRnqQ9uq.jpg","id":"4ea6931634f8633bdc00c463"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":609,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 05:45:05 UTC"}]
