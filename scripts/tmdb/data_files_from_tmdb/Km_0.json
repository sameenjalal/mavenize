But the question is: will you be listening? You might be too busy watching in amazement as a four metre White Shark – weighing 1½ tons – cruises the big blue with a diver clutching her dorsal fin. Every spare synapse will be used up as the same diver gently wrestles a Tiger shark into catatonia, its oven-wide head and tooth-riddled jaw inches from his face. You will be too busy gawping as Caribbean Reef and Black Tip sharks cuddle in the lap of Gansbaai free diver Mike Rutzen, also known as South Africa's \"shark whisperer\"...\" (excerpt from a press article by Steve Pike, about the film commissioned by Animal Planet and Discovery Channel to, acclaimed Cape Town filmmakers, the Foster Brothers).","released":"2007-03-17","posters":[],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:23:04 UTC"},{"score":0.7261873,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Werckmeister harmóniák","name":"Werckmeister Harmonies","alternative_name":"Werckmeister harmóniák","movie_type":"movie","id":23160,"imdb_id":"tt0249241","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/23160","votes":1,"rating":8.0,"certification":"","overview":"This story takes place in a small town on the Hungarian Plain.

The people are coming from everywhere. From the neighboring settlings, even from quite far away parts of the country. They are following this clumsy monster as a dumb, faceless, rag-wearing crowd. This strange state of affairs - the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost - disturbs the order of the small town. Aambitious personages of the story feel they can take advantage of this situation. The tension growing to the unbearable is brought to explosion by the figure of the Prince, who is pretending facelessness. Even his mere appearance is enough to break loose destructive emotions...","released":"2000-10-01","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/7Hqy3GDNl5irPiDlBEKrJD02Qkb.jpg","id":"4ea64d6734f8633bdc0072cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/7Hqy3GDNl5irPiDlBEKrJD02Qkb.jpg","id":"4ea64d6734f8633bdc0072cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/7Hqy3GDNl5irPiDlBEKrJD02Qkb.jpg","id":"4ea64d6734f8633bdc0072cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":479,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/7Hqy3GDNl5irPiDlBEKrJD02Qkb.jpg","id":"4ea64d6734f8633bdc0072cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":701,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/7Hqy3GDNl5irPiDlBEKrJD02Qkb.jpg","id":"4ea64d6734f8633bdc0072cd"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":939,"width":670,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/7Hqy3GDNl5irPiDlBEKrJD02Qkb.jpg","id":"4ea64d6734f8633bdc0072cd"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/3lzH4M62Wpvx3TdOX5jYmfstHJd.jpg","id":"4ea64d6934f8633bdc0072cf"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/3lzH4M62Wpvx3TdOX5jYmfstHJd.jpg","id":"4ea64d6934f8633bdc0072cf"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/3lzH4M62Wpvx3TdOX5jYmfstHJd.jpg","id":"4ea64d6934f8633bdc0072cf"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/3lzH4M62Wpvx3TdOX5jYmfstHJd.jpg","id":"4ea64d6934f8633bdc0072cf"}}],"version":289,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-24 02:41:47 UTC"},{"score":1.1010978,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"KM 31: Kilometro 31","name":"KM 31: Kilometro 31","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":20015,"imdb_id":"tt0460485","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/20015","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"No overview found.","released":"2006-10-19","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":132,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/2RLwNRSGEa7pDPnQi9zektEhUcb.jpg","id":"4ea644cc34f8633bdc006b07"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":221,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/2RLwNRSGEa7pDPnQi9zektEhUcb.jpg","id":"4ea644cc34f8633bdc006b07"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":265,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/2RLwNRSGEa7pDPnQi9zektEhUcb.jpg","id":"4ea644cc34f8633bdc006b07"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":491,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/2RLwNRSGEa7pDPnQi9zektEhUcb.jpg","id":"4ea644cc34f8633bdc006b07"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":718,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/2RLwNRSGEa7pDPnQi9zektEhUcb.jpg","id":"4ea644cc34f8633bdc006b07"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1435,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/2RLwNRSGEa7pDPnQi9zektEhUcb.jpg","id":"4ea644cc34f8633bdc006b07"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/gzkcDuTpdeSOSGzKGYtTDN3HnWC.jpg","id":"4ea644ca34f8633bdc006b05"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/gzkcDuTpdeSOSGzKGYtTDN3HnWC.jpg","id":"4ea644ca34f8633bdc006b05"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/gzkcDuTpdeSOSGzKGYtTDN3HnWC.jpg","id":"4ea644ca34f8633bdc006b05"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/gzkcDuTpdeSOSGzKGYtTDN3HnWC.jpg","id":"4ea644ca34f8633bdc006b05"}}],"version":96,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 17:45:13 UTC"},{"score":0.5062517,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"L'île de Black Mór","name":"L'île de Black Mór","alternative_name":"Le trésor de Blackmore","movie_type":"movie","id":22568,"imdb_id":"tt0364084","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/22568","votes":1,"rating":5.0,"certification":"","overview":"Kid, a 15-year-old hard laborer, steals a map that promises to reveal the location of the notorious pirate Black Mor's treasure.
