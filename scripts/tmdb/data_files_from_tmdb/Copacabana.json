Never having cared about social conventions, she is suddenly faced with the realization that her own daughter is ashamed of her and therefore refuses to invite her to her wedding. Hurt in her pride, Babou tries to regain her daughter's respect by starting anew. She accepts the challenge of selling time-sharing-flats at the Belgian seaside during the off-season, in a desperate attempt to prove her real worth and her motherly love to her daughter.","released":"2010-07-07","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":125,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/pwLHaJlaQIBkPe11Ly1sK6y1SPU.jpg","id":"4ea684539dc3d83c3b00a669"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":209,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/pwLHaJlaQIBkPe11Ly1sK6y1SPU.jpg","id":"4ea684539dc3d83c3b00a669"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":251,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/pwLHaJlaQIBkPe11Ly1sK6y1SPU.jpg","id":"4ea684539dc3d83c3b00a669"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":464,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/pwLHaJlaQIBkPe11Ly1sK6y1SPU.jpg","id":"4ea684539dc3d83c3b00a669"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":678,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/pwLHaJlaQIBkPe11Ly1sK6y1SPU.jpg","id":"4ea684539dc3d83c3b00a669"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":903,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/pwLHaJlaQIBkPe11Ly1sK6y1SPU.jpg","id":"4ea684539dc3d83c3b00a669"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/dFjZCAMxOuZUwie9xOJzAdN1OZB.jpg","id":"4ea684559dc3d83c3b00a66b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/dFjZCAMxOuZUwie9xOJzAdN1OZB.jpg","id":"4ea684559dc3d83c3b00a66b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/dFjZCAMxOuZUwie9xOJzAdN1OZB.jpg","id":"4ea684559dc3d83c3b00a66b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/dFjZCAMxOuZUwie9xOJzAdN1OZB.jpg","id":"4ea684559dc3d83c3b00a66b"}}],"version":348,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 14:17:48 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Copacabana","name":"Copacabana","alternative_name":"Barry Manilow's Copacabana","movie_type":"movie","id":45199,"imdb_id":"tt0088951","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/45199","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"A hit song is the inspiration for this movie.
