The word around is that he is impotent and Carrie is looking for the truth. Of course, from there you are looking to see if they will hook up. Also here are Raymond (Lau Ching Wan) as Carrie's ex, a judge and a very young looking Charlene Choi, who plays Tabbie, who wants to live with Raymond. In a small but fun interlude, the always great Sandra Ng plays Bobo.","released":"2003-01-01","posters":[],"backdrops":[],"version":124,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 17:08:34 UTC"}]
