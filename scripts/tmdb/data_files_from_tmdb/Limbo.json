She is introduced to a homeless class of men who have the whole world as their workplace - and their wives, who follow them wherever their contracts take them. On the surface these women live lives in luxury with large houses and servants. The days are uneventful and blend together into an everlasting holiday, where the women nurse their superficial relationships over cocktails poolside â€“ the perfect climate for self-delusion.","released":"2010-09-10","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":140,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/f502RCezZjkN0apOf2OdGL7pNq2.jpg","id":"4ea69be69dc3d83c3b00c57d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":235,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/f502RCezZjkN0apOf2OdGL7pNq2.jpg","id":"4ea69be69dc3d83c3b00c57d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":282,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/f502RCezZjkN0apOf2OdGL7pNq2.jpg","id":"4ea69be69dc3d83c3b00c57d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":522,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/f502RCezZjkN0apOf2OdGL7pNq2.jpg","id":"4ea69be69dc3d83c3b00c57d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":763,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/f502RCezZjkN0apOf2OdGL7pNq2.jpg","id":"4ea69be69dc3d83c3b00c57d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1374,"width":900,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/f502RCezZjkN0apOf2OdGL7pNq2.jpg","id":"4ea69be69dc3d83c3b00c57d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/xYy9i1957aDfhthth9zU0tVyrix.jpg","id":"4ea69be39dc3d83c3b00c579"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/xYy9i1957aDfhthth9zU0tVyrix.jpg","id":"4ea69be39dc3d83c3b00c579"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/xYy9i1957aDfhthth9zU0tVyrix.jpg","id":"4ea69be39dc3d83c3b00c579"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/xYy9i1957aDfhthth9zU0tVyrix.jpg","id":"4ea69be39dc3d83c3b00c579"}}],"version":379,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:01:51 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Limbo","name":"Limbo","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":62676,"imdb_id":"tt0164085","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/62676","votes":1,"rating":7.5,"certification":"","overview":"Unconventional narrative about the interactions amongst a group of people in a small town in Alaska, each of whom has guards a secret.","released":"1999-06-04","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/dQOjALrOYmnM81yCiQDvRKX1KBf.jpg","id":"4ea6ad319dc3d83c3b00de8b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/dQOjALrOYmnM81yCiQDvRKX1KBf.jpg","id":"4ea6ad319dc3d83c3b00de8b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/dQOjALrOYmnM81yCiQDvRKX1KBf.jpg","id":"4ea6ad319dc3d83c3b00de8b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/dQOjALrOYmnM81yCiQDvRKX1KBf.jpg","id":"4ea6ad319dc3d83c3b00de8b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/dQOjALrOYmnM81yCiQDvRKX1KBf.jpg","id":"4ea6ad319dc3d83c3b00de8b"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":755,"width":510,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/dQOjALrOYmnM81yCiQDvRKX1KBf.jpg","id":"4ea6ad319dc3d83c3b00de8b"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":460,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 13:51:31 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Limbo","name":"Limbo","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":73607,"imdb_id":"tt0405106","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/73607","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"Limbo is the story of a man in search of his identity.
