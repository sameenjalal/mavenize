Living like a wild animal and unable to speak or understand language, the child has apparently grown up in solitude in the forest since an early age. He is brought to Paris and initially placed in a school for \"deaf-mutes\". Dr. Jean Marc Gaspard Itard (François Truffaut) observes the boy and believes that he is neither deaf nor, as some of his colleagues do, an \"idiot\". Itard thinks the boy's behavior is a result of his deprived environment, and that he can be educated. Itard takes custody of the boy, whom he eventually names Victor. Under the patient tutelage of the doctor and his housekeeper (Françoise Seigner), Victor gradually becomes socialized and acquires the rudiments of language.","released":"1970-02-26","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/fhS4Y2J4p6fBZSssmbvC9VrE0BE.jpg","id":"4ea5e58f2c058837cb0015cf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":206,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/fhS4Y2J4p6fBZSssmbvC9VrE0BE.jpg","id":"4ea5e58f2c058837cb0015cf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":248,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/fhS4Y2J4p6fBZSssmbvC9VrE0BE.jpg","id":"4ea5e58f2c058837cb0015cf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":459,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/fhS4Y2J4p6fBZSssmbvC9VrE0BE.jpg","id":"4ea5e58f2c058837cb0015cf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":670,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/fhS4Y2J4p6fBZSssmbvC9VrE0BE.jpg","id":"4ea5e58f2c058837cb0015cf"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":299,"width":223,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/fhS4Y2J4p6fBZSssmbvC9VrE0BE.jpg","id":"4ea5e58f2c058837cb0015cf"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/hfb80BzGPj8vHk8RJ5pjxq4kk17.jpg","id":"4ea5e5942c058837cb0015d3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/hfb80BzGPj8vHk8RJ5pjxq4kk17.jpg","id":"4ea5e5942c058837cb0015d3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/hfb80BzGPj8vHk8RJ5pjxq4kk17.jpg","id":"4ea5e5942c058837cb0015d3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/hfb80BzGPj8vHk8RJ5pjxq4kk17.jpg","id":"4ea5e5942c058837cb0015d3"}}],"version":292,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 01:59:00 UTC"}]
