Stumbling into a job at \"Daybreak\" (the last-place national morning news show), Becky decides to revitalize the show by bringing on legendary TV anchor Mike Pomeroy (Ford).  Unfortunately, Pomeroy refuses to cover morning show staples like celebrity gossip, weather, fashion and crafts – let alone work with his new co-host, Colleen Peck (Keaton), a former beauty queen and longtime morning show personality who is more than happy covering morning \"news.\" As Mike and Colleen clash, first behind the scenes and then on the air, Becky's blossoming love affair with fellow producer, Adam Bennett (Wilson) begins to unravel – and soon Becky is struggling to save her relationship, her reputation, her job and ultimately, the show itself.","released":"2010-11-10","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/xGaQhRganJgCDdSy1WlK4xcHezU.jpg","id":"4ea667382c058837cb00a279"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/xGaQhRganJgCDdSy1WlK4xcHezU.jpg","id":"4ea667382c058837cb00a279"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/xGaQhRganJgCDdSy1WlK4xcHezU.jpg","id":"4ea667382c058837cb00a279"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":507,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/xGaQhRganJgCDdSy1WlK4xcHezU.jpg","id":"4ea667382c058837cb00a279"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":741,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/xGaQhRganJgCDdSy1WlK4xcHezU.jpg","id":"4ea667382c058837cb00a279"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1400,"width":945,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/xGaQhRganJgCDdSy1WlK4xcHezU.jpg","id":"4ea667382c058837cb00a279"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/iG9m93hbjXyv2DtJx7e0KzH4SMW.jpg","id":"4ea667322c058837cb00a273"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/iG9m93hbjXyv2DtJx7e0KzH4SMW.jpg","id":"4ea667322c058837cb00a273"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/iG9m93hbjXyv2DtJx7e0KzH4SMW.jpg","id":"4ea667322c058837cb00a273"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/iG9m93hbjXyv2DtJx7e0KzH4SMW.jpg","id":"4ea667322c058837cb00a273"}}],"version":1310,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 21:20:53 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Morning Glory","name":"Morning Glory","alternative_name":"La gloria del mattino","movie_type":"movie","id":31777,"imdb_id":"tt0024353","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/31777","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"Eva Lovelace, would-be actress trying to crash the New York stage, is a wildly optimistic chatterbox full of theatrical mannerisms.
