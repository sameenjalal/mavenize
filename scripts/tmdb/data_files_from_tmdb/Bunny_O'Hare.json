When that heist ends up paying off, rather than take off for the border, Bunny opts for a life of crime with her new partner, Bill Green, played by fellow Oscar-winner Ernest Borgnine.","released":"1971-10-18","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":123,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/s7i4POYPA0zQL5cxlurB14fCCYx.jpg","id":"4f345f9a19c2950b7e0000ce"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":206,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/s7i4POYPA0zQL5cxlurB14fCCYx.jpg","id":"4f345f9a19c2950b7e0000ce"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":248,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/s7i4POYPA0zQL5cxlurB14fCCYx.jpg","id":"4f345f9a19c2950b7e0000ce"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":458,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/s7i4POYPA0zQL5cxlurB14fCCYx.jpg","id":"4f345f9a19c2950b7e0000ce"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":670,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/s7i4POYPA0zQL5cxlurB14fCCYx.jpg","id":"4f345f9a19c2950b7e0000ce"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":670,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/s7i4POYPA0zQL5cxlurB14fCCYx.jpg","id":"4f345f9a19c2950b7e0000ce"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 16:09:44 UTC"}]
