When his girlfriend Nadine up and moves to Shanghai, a love-sick Zinos decides to fly after her, leaving his restaurant in the hands of his unreliable ex-con brother Illias. Both decisions turn out disastrous: Illias gambles away the restaurant to a shady real estate agent, and Zinos finds Nadine with a new lover. If the brothers can stop arguing and get it together, the Soul Kitchen might still have one last chance at staying in business. The mayhem that follows is a hilariously entertaining story of self-realization, set to an irresistibly soulful soundtrack.","released":"2009-09-10","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/x38SduFnKlPJpb4ZxUzN4mv8IZ.jpg","id":"4ea6674934f8633bdc008bf7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/x38SduFnKlPJpb4ZxUzN4mv8IZ.jpg","id":"4ea6674934f8633bdc008bf7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/x38SduFnKlPJpb4ZxUzN4mv8IZ.jpg","id":"4ea6674934f8633bdc008bf7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":507,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/x38SduFnKlPJpb4ZxUzN4mv8IZ.jpg","id":"4ea6674934f8633bdc008bf7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":741,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/x38SduFnKlPJpb4ZxUzN4mv8IZ.jpg","id":"4ea6674934f8633bdc008bf7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1481,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/x38SduFnKlPJpb4ZxUzN4mv8IZ.jpg","id":"4ea6674934f8633bdc008bf7"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/8YRAejhpbIkCYdCoPR1xV5MFA44.jpg","id":"4ea6674334f8633bdc008bef"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/8YRAejhpbIkCYdCoPR1xV5MFA44.jpg","id":"4ea6674334f8633bdc008bef"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/8YRAejhpbIkCYdCoPR1xV5MFA44.jpg","id":"4ea6674334f8633bdc008bef"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/8YRAejhpbIkCYdCoPR1xV5MFA44.jpg","id":"4ea6674334f8633bdc008bef"}}],"version":650,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 12:28:37 UTC"}]
