Nos trois héros se font arrêter à nouveau et ils sont conduits dans un château où une grande partie de l'état-major français est retenu prisonnier. Les trois bidasses, devenus officiers malgré eux, seront sur le point de faire évader tous ces officiers quand, malencontreusement, ils se retrouvent libres alors que le reste des officiers est obligé de rebrousser chemin. S'ensuit une petite série d'évasions à chaque fois sous l'œil médusé de leur supérieur le capitaine Dumont qui ne comprend pas comment font ces trois toquards pour s'évader.","released":"1975-12-10","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":124,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/pqoBBM3qwKnMTXLUFdakFTAbf2a.jpg","id":"4ea71ed234f863633c004eb7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":207,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/pqoBBM3qwKnMTXLUFdakFTAbf2a.jpg","id":"4ea71ed234f863633c004eb7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":248,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/pqoBBM3qwKnMTXLUFdakFTAbf2a.jpg","id":"4ea71ed234f863633c004eb7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":459,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/pqoBBM3qwKnMTXLUFdakFTAbf2a.jpg","id":"4ea71ed234f863633c004eb7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":671,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/pqoBBM3qwKnMTXLUFdakFTAbf2a.jpg","id":"4ea71ed234f863633c004eb7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":823,"width":613,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/pqoBBM3qwKnMTXLUFdakFTAbf2a.jpg","id":"4ea71ed234f863633c004eb7"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":167,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/jldx899buYdOUyWB7i1B9YG6JGe.jpg","id":"4ea71ed334f863633c004eb9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":435,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/jldx899buYdOUyWB7i1B9YG6JGe.jpg","id":"4ea71ed334f863633c004eb9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":714,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/jldx899buYdOUyWB7i1B9YG6JGe.jpg","id":"4ea71ed334f863633c004eb9"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1071,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/jldx899buYdOUyWB7i1B9YG6JGe.jpg","id":"4ea71ed334f863633c004eb9"}}],"version":52,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 13:11:08 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"9 Rota","name":"9th Company","alternative_name":"9 Rota","movie_type":"movie","id":14097,"imdb_id":"tt0417397","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/14097","votes":4,"rating":7.9,"certification":null,"overview":"The picture opens in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in late 1988, when military trainees Petrovsky, Ryaba, Chugun, Stas, Pinochet, Lyutev and Vorobyev are whipped into shape at a training camp by the brutal, sadistic commander, Warrant Officer Dygalo - prior to being sent off to the front lines. After several one-by-one dalliances with the local whore, Snow White, and a cautionary lecture on the history, geography and culture of Afghanistan (which most of the men sleep through), the trainees head off to battle - first to the Bagram air base, then to the Afghani province of Khost to secure supply lines.

Consumerism had not set in. It was devoid of most of the luxuries of the West. In fact everything \"imported\" was good, and everything Indian, passé. Badmaash Company is an extraordinary story set in the 1990's in middle class Bombay (as it was known then), of four ordinary youngsters (Shahid Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Meiyang Chаng and Vir Das), who came together to start an import business of things longed for by yuppie Indians! What made their venture such a stupendous success was the fact that they found a way to beat the system and soon became the undisputed kings in their business, realizing their one dream of making quick money by doing all the wrong things... the right way! Living the life of champagne wishes and caviar dreams, the four friends discover that to make a business successful you don't need big money.
