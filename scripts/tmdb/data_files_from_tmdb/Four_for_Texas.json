pioneer Wim Wenders (Wings of Desire) brings his keen eye for landscape to the American Southwest in Paris, Texas, a profoundly moving character study written by Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Sam

Paris, Texas follows the mysterious, nearly mute drifter Travis (a magnificent Harry Dean Stanton, whose face is a landscape all its own) as he tries to reconnect with his young son, living with his brother (Dean Stockwell) in Los Angeles, and his missing wife (Nastassja Kinski). From this simple setup, Wenders and Shepard produce a powerful statement on codes of masculinity and the myth of the American family, as well as an exquisite visual exploration of a vast, crumbling world of canyons and neon.","released":"1984-05-19","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":124,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/3tuK3GVigFUC9ei9mCuLyE3Tzsi.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2e34f8633bdc000c4d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":207,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/3tuK3GVigFUC9ei9mCuLyE3Tzsi.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2e34f8633bdc000c4d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":249,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/3tuK3GVigFUC9ei9mCuLyE3Tzsi.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2e34f8633bdc000c4d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":460,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/3tuK3GVigFUC9ei9mCuLyE3Tzsi.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2e34f8633bdc000c4d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":673,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/3tuK3GVigFUC9ei9mCuLyE3Tzsi.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2e34f8633bdc000c4d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":600,"width":446,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/3tuK3GVigFUC9ei9mCuLyE3Tzsi.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2e34f8633bdc000c4d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/tcspqFN6opuwCJoe018YoQIm9ym.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2434f8633bdc000c45"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/tcspqFN6opuwCJoe018YoQIm9ym.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2434f8633bdc000c45"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/tcspqFN6opuwCJoe018YoQIm9ym.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2434f8633bdc000c45"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/tcspqFN6opuwCJoe018YoQIm9ym.jpg","id":"4ea5cf2434f8633bdc000c45"}}],"version":414,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 18:26:57 UTC"},{"score":1.3354506,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Some Girls - Live In Texas","name":"Some Girls - Live In Texas","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":81948,"imdb_id":"tt2190405","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/81948","votes":1,"rating":7.5,"certification":"","overview":"The Rolling Stones 1978 tour of the USA in support of that year's Some Girls album is considered by fans to be one of their very best.

Logo após o fim da guerra civil ()1861-1865), dois antigos combatentes, vagam pelo Texas em busca de dinheiro, comida e trabalho. Porém, apenas encontram problemas. Primeiro convertem-se em pugilistas, profissionais de boxe, logo presenciam um assalto a uma diligência, e conseguem arrebatar o dinheiro dos ladrões e horas depois estão a frente de um grupo de homens que querem enforcá-los. Um lindo faroeste, com tintas românticas que mostra como pano de fundo a dispusta de dois homens pelo amor de uma mulher.","released":"1941-08-15","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":480,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":701,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":713,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}}],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 12:16:21 UTC"},{"score":1.5744944,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Eyes of Texas","name":"Eyes of Texas","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":53112,"imdb_id":"tt0040333","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/53112","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"G","overview":"A ranch owner (Francis Ford) turns his place into a home for boys who have lost their fathers in World War II.
