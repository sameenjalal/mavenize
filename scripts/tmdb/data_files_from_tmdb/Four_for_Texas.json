Logo apÃ³s o fim da guerra civil ()1861-1865), dois antigos combatentes, vagam pelo Texas em busca de dinheiro, comida e trabalho. PorÃ©m, apenas encontram problemas. Primeiro convertem-se em pugilistas, profissionais de boxe, logo presenciam um assalto a uma diligÃªncia, e conseguem arrebatar o dinheiro dos ladrÃµes e horas depois estÃ£o a frente de um grupo de homens que querem enforcÃ¡-los. Um lindo faroeste, com tintas romÃ¢nticas que mostra como pano de fundo a dispusta de dois homens pelo amor de uma mulher.","released":"1941-08-15","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":480,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":701,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1000,"width":713,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1LErVGfebs4VQaABi8ybYwy5uA0.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8d34f8633bdc01022f"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/hp4n0gZpW3LC7LNUZPPh459SJLV.jpg","id":"4ea6bb8e34f8633bdc010231"}}],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 12:16:21 UTC"},{"score":1.5744944,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Eyes of Texas","name":"Eyes of Texas","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":53112,"imdb_id":"tt0040333","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/53112","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"G","overview":"A ranch owner (Francis Ford) turns his place into a home for boys who have lost their fathers in World War II.
