The husband chafes at the confinement of high society, though, and yearns for a creative outlet. He decides to write a play and collaborates with a fellow reporter (Loretta Young); the results are unexpectedly hilarious, especially when Young shows up at the mansion with a gaggle of boozehound reporters in tow. With snappy, ribald dialogue (allowable in those pre-Hays Code days), Capra keeps the gags flying fast and furious, taking special delight in having Williams's journalist pals rib him endlessly over his kept-man status. Platinum Blonde was a great success at the time of its release during the class-conscious Depression; for better or worse, its star Harlow was identified with the tag \"platinum blonde\" until her untimely death. --Jerry Renshaw","released":"1931-10-31","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":184,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/tehJ5GKXTQ3QeyFovA0Zn8lsbVh.jpg","id":"4ea6edeb34f863633c000055"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":308,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/tehJ5GKXTQ3QeyFovA0Zn8lsbVh.jpg","id":"4ea6edeb34f863633c000055"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":370,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/tehJ5GKXTQ3QeyFovA0Zn8lsbVh.jpg","id":"4ea6edeb34f863633c000055"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":684,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/tehJ5GKXTQ3QeyFovA0Zn8lsbVh.jpg","id":"4ea6edeb34f863633c000055"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":1000,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/tehJ5GKXTQ3QeyFovA0Zn8lsbVh.jpg","id":"4ea6edeb34f863633c000055"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1332,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/tehJ5GKXTQ3QeyFovA0Zn8lsbVh.jpg","id":"4ea6edeb34f863633c000055"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/dbDEMDhsm0RKmIlbJ5OySSkeiic.jpg","id":"4ea65cf54f13c137cc008029"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/dbDEMDhsm0RKmIlbJ5OySSkeiic.jpg","id":"4ea65cf54f13c137cc008029"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/dbDEMDhsm0RKmIlbJ5OySSkeiic.jpg","id":"4ea65cf54f13c137cc008029"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/dbDEMDhsm0RKmIlbJ5OySSkeiic.jpg","id":"4ea65cf54f13c137cc008029"}}],"version":424,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 22:40:19 UTC"}]
