Painter, sculptor, engineer, and scientist, in each field Leonardo da Vinci was both master and pioneer. Creator of some of the world's great artistic masterpieces, such as the Last Supper and the Mona Lisa, he was also a visionary whose fantastic inventions would become reality only hundreds of years after his death.

From the producers of Islam: Empire of Faith and Barbarians, and available on DVD for the first time ever, DA VINCI AND THE CODE HE LIVED BY tells the remarkable story of one man's boundless talent, his towering legacy, and his courage in the face of powerful adversity.","released":"2006-01-31","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/zg7U5niG1WrYBZOuEY4Bz8AFJT0.jpg","id":"4ea6ac8f9dc3d83c3b00dd79"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":218,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/zg7U5niG1WrYBZOuEY4Bz8AFJT0.jpg","id":"4ea6ac8f9dc3d83c3b00dd79"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/zg7U5niG1WrYBZOuEY4Bz8AFJT0.jpg","id":"4ea6ac8f9dc3d83c3b00dd79"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":483,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/zg7U5niG1WrYBZOuEY4Bz8AFJT0.jpg","id":"4ea6ac8f9dc3d83c3b00dd79"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":706,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/zg7U5niG1WrYBZOuEY4Bz8AFJT0.jpg","id":"4ea6ac8f9dc3d83c3b00dd79"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":565,"width":400,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/zg7U5niG1WrYBZOuEY4Bz8AFJT0.jpg","id":"4ea6ac8f9dc3d83c3b00dd79"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":158,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 18:26:45 UTC"}]
