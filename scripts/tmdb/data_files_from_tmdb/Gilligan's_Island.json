In desperation, the castaways lash their huts together into one structure in order to have any chance to ride the disaster out.","released":"1978-10-14","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/ltMi8J9NBolHc4iyKaJn0o5vUle.jpg","id":"4ea65be02c058837cb00930d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/ltMi8J9NBolHc4iyKaJn0o5vUle.jpg","id":"4ea65be02c058837cb00930d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":260,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/ltMi8J9NBolHc4iyKaJn0o5vUle.jpg","id":"4ea65be02c058837cb00930d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":481,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/ltMi8J9NBolHc4iyKaJn0o5vUle.jpg","id":"4ea65be02c058837cb00930d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":703,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/ltMi8J9NBolHc4iyKaJn0o5vUle.jpg","id":"4ea65be02c058837cb00930d"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":475,"width":338,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/ltMi8J9NBolHc4iyKaJn0o5vUle.jpg","id":"4ea65be02c058837cb00930d"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/9wnBBDwktBJXS81X4oWaQo3oaGC.jpg","id":"4ea65bdf2c058837cb00930b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/9wnBBDwktBJXS81X4oWaQo3oaGC.jpg","id":"4ea65bdf2c058837cb00930b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/9wnBBDwktBJXS81X4oWaQo3oaGC.jpg","id":"4ea65bdf2c058837cb00930b"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/9wnBBDwktBJXS81X4oWaQo3oaGC.jpg","id":"4ea65bdf2c058837cb00930b"}}],"version":528,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 09:01:10 UTC"},{"score":3.1804867,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"GILLIGANS'S ISLAND","name":"GILLIGANS'S ISLAND","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":51772,"imdb_id":null,"url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/51772","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"Despite critical barbs as sharp as a Maroobi spear, Gilligan's Island has proven unsinkable. Its first season was 1964's top-rated show. The expository theme song is one of television's most quoted, and its characters--the Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.), first mate Gilligan (Bob Denver), the millionaire (Jim Backus) and his wife (Natalie Schaefer), a movie star (Tina Louise), \"and the rest\" (Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells, as the Professor and Mary Ann, wouldn't get their opening credit props until season two)--are pop culture icons. Revisiting the first season's 36 episodes is a not-guilty-at-all pleasure. Some sure and surprising hands piloted these inaugural episodes, including Ida Lupino, Jack Arnold (The Creature from the Black Lagoon), Christian Nyby (The Thing), and Richard Donner (who went on to direct Superman and Lethal Weapon).","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":138,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/bJKkIMuVY29PItb7390e3uBgz8C.jpg","id":"4ea684cc2c058837cb00c9af"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":231,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/bJKkIMuVY29PItb7390e3uBgz8C.jpg","id":"4ea684cc2c058837cb00c9af"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":278,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/bJKkIMuVY29PItb7390e3uBgz8C.jpg","id":"4ea684cc2c058837cb00c9af"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":513,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/bJKkIMuVY29PItb7390e3uBgz8C.jpg","id":"4ea684cc2c058837cb00c9af"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":750,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/bJKkIMuVY29PItb7390e3uBgz8C.jpg","id":"4ea684cc2c058837cb00c9af"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":1500,"width":1000,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/bJKkIMuVY29PItb7390e3uBgz8C.jpg","id":"4ea684cc2c058837cb00c9af"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/udSTqdOSNJubiddVWspP5EnNc8W.jpg","id":"4ea684ce2c058837cb00c9b1"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/udSTqdOSNJubiddVWspP5EnNc8W.jpg","id":"4ea684ce2c058837cb00c9b1"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/udSTqdOSNJubiddVWspP5EnNc8W.jpg","id":"4ea684ce2c058837cb00c9b1"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/udSTqdOSNJubiddVWspP5EnNc8W.jpg","id":"4ea684ce2c058837cb00c9b1"}}],"version":2256,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 07:52:32 UTC"}]
