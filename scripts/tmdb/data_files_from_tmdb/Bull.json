A hapless stockbroker named Charlie finds himself caught up in a twisty web where no one — no one at all — is telling the truth. Charlie isn't very good at his job — something his powerbroker boss Jay explains to him in exactly so many words. But then Jay also offers him an opportunity: a vague and somewhat shady opportunity, sure, but Charlie doesn't have much choice. And before long Charlie finds himself mixed up with all manner of dangerous characters, persistent detectives, beautiful women wearing surprisingly little, and a threatening and mysterious individual named Roland Gow.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":121,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg","id":"4ea6a37334f8633bdc00da89"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":202,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg","id":"4ea6a37334f8633bdc00da89"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":243,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg","id":"4ea6a37334f8633bdc00da89"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":449,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg","id":"4ea6a37334f8633bdc00da89"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":657,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg","id":"4ea6a37334f8633bdc00da89"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":875,"width":666,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/rNrqlgWrPixy84yerex4zb8qFYr.jpg","id":"4ea6a37334f8633bdc00da89"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1491,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-21 19:12:25 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Bullitt","name":"Bullitt","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":916,"imdb_id":"tt0062765","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/916","votes":6,"rating":6.9,"certification":"PG","overview":"Bullitt is an American action thriller from director Peter Yates from 1968.

Then into the film: Laurence Sterne's unfilmable novel, Tristram Shandy, a fictive autobiography wherein the narrator, interrupted constantly, takes the entire story to be born. The film tracks between \"Shandy\" and behind the scenes. Size matters: parts, egos, shoes, noses. The lead's girlfriend, with their infant son, is up from London for the night, wanting sex; interruptions are constant. Scenes are shot, re-shot, and discarded. The purpose of the project is elusive. Fathers and sons; men and women; cocks and bulls.

Taylor is a pretty 17-year-old high school student but a little awkward, and painfully aware of it. When her mom gives her a computer for her birthday, Taylor is excited by the prospect of freedom and the independence of going online without her mother always looking over her shoulder.
