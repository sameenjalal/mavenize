Being overlooked and understanding German, she learns of the repressive attitude of the regent and the plans of his reformist, pro-German minor son, king Nicholas, to take over power by surprise, but doesn't dodge and tries to reconcile father and son. The queen-dowager decides to make her lady-in-waiting for the coronation day, so she stays in the picture to everyone else's surprise.","released":"1957-06-13","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":135,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/nK9JZhTNYFBdTPg9XEwcLNyIRLK.jpg","id":"4ea6480b2c058837cb0077eb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":225,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/nK9JZhTNYFBdTPg9XEwcLNyIRLK.jpg","id":"4ea6480b2c058837cb0077eb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":271,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/nK9JZhTNYFBdTPg9XEwcLNyIRLK.jpg","id":"4ea6480b2c058837cb0077eb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":500,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/nK9JZhTNYFBdTPg9XEwcLNyIRLK.jpg","id":"4ea6480b2c058837cb0077eb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":731,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/nK9JZhTNYFBdTPg9XEwcLNyIRLK.jpg","id":"4ea6480b2c058837cb0077eb"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":2106,"width":1440,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/nK9JZhTNYFBdTPg9XEwcLNyIRLK.jpg","id":"4ea6480b2c058837cb0077eb"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/moQHniiChmEDGp45QFKgl2bR6ky.jpg","id":"4ea648062c058837cb0077e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/moQHniiChmEDGp45QFKgl2bR6ky.jpg","id":"4ea648062c058837cb0077e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/moQHniiChmEDGp45QFKgl2bR6ky.jpg","id":"4ea648062c058837cb0077e3"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/moQHniiChmEDGp45QFKgl2bR6ky.jpg","id":"4ea648062c058837cb0077e3"}}],"version":429,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-23 13:58:01 UTC"}]
