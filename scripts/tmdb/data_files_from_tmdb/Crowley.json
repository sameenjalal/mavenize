Working-class father John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) is finally on the fast track to corporate success when his two young children, Megan and Patrick, are diagnosed with Pompe disease -- a condition that prevents the body from breaking down sugar. In time, it disables the heart and the muscles, ultimately resulting in death. With the support of his wife, Aileen (Keri Russell), John ditches his career and teams with unconventional specialist Dr. Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford) to found a bio-tech company and develop a cure in time to save the lives of Megan and Patrick. As Dr. Stonehill works tirelessly to prove the theories that made him the black sheep of the medical community, a powerful bond is forged between the two unlikely allies. Still, their greatest struggle is yet to come.","released":"2010-01-22","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":136,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/u5esitHyuBYWRa7RzJ9bZJg52YT.jpg","id":"4f131efa760ee37375007263"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":228,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/u5esitHyuBYWRa7RzJ9bZJg52YT.jpg","id":"4f131efa760ee37375007263"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":274,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/u5esitHyuBYWRa7RzJ9bZJg52YT.jpg","id":"4f131efa760ee37375007263"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":506,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/u5esitHyuBYWRa7RzJ9bZJg52YT.jpg","id":"4f131efa760ee37375007263"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":740,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/u5esitHyuBYWRa7RzJ9bZJg52YT.jpg","id":"4f131efa760ee37375007263"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":666,"width":450,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/u5esitHyuBYWRa7RzJ9bZJg52YT.jpg","id":"4f131efa760ee37375007263"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/mG9AS695c0TUdnvt43OCALwWuuL.jpg","id":"4ea65f624f13c137cc008253"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/mG9AS695c0TUdnvt43OCALwWuuL.jpg","id":"4ea65f624f13c137cc008253"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/mG9AS695c0TUdnvt43OCALwWuuL.jpg","id":"4ea65f624f13c137cc008253"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":1080,"width":1920,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/mG9AS695c0TUdnvt43OCALwWuuL.jpg","id":"4ea65f624f13c137cc008253"}}],"version":782,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-22 13:17:41 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"Aleister Crowley: The Other Loch Ness Monster","name":"Aleister Crowley: The Other Loch Ness Monster","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":75466,"imdb_id":"tt1674855","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/75466","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":null,"overview":"A quirky and fascinating short documentary on the “most wickedest man in the world” and his time at Boleskine House, at the turn of the last century.","released":"2000-08-11","posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":129,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/1es1V6GBEWWTz66midQlRh1hx2X.jpg","id":"4ea6be389dc3d83c3b00fab3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":216,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/1es1V6GBEWWTz66midQlRh1hx2X.jpg","id":"4ea6be389dc3d83c3b00fab3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":259,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/1es1V6GBEWWTz66midQlRh1hx2X.jpg","id":"4ea6be389dc3d83c3b00fab3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":479,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1es1V6GBEWWTz66midQlRh1hx2X.jpg","id":"4ea6be389dc3d83c3b00fab3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":700,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/1es1V6GBEWWTz66midQlRh1hx2X.jpg","id":"4ea6be389dc3d83c3b00fab3"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":700,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/1es1V6GBEWWTz66midQlRh1hx2X.jpg","id":"4ea6be389dc3d83c3b00fab3"}}],"backdrops":[{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"thumb","height":169,"width":300,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w300/20rc1eMgTJEKZbpJKLgucuALEbv.jpg","id":"4ea6be3a9dc3d83c3b00fab5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"poster","height":439,"width":780,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w780/20rc1eMgTJEKZbpJKLgucuALEbv.jpg","id":"4ea6be3a9dc3d83c3b00fab5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"w1280","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w1280/20rc1eMgTJEKZbpJKLgucuALEbv.jpg","id":"4ea6be3a9dc3d83c3b00fab5"}},{"image":{"type":"backdrop","size":"original","height":720,"width":1280,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/20rc1eMgTJEKZbpJKLgucuALEbv.jpg","id":"4ea6be3a9dc3d83c3b00fab5"}}],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 17:25:24 UTC"},{"score":null,"popularity":3,"translated":true,"adult":false,"language":"en","original_name":"The Ghosts of Crowley Hall","name":"The Ghosts of Crowley Hall","alternative_name":null,"movie_type":"movie","id":77854,"imdb_id":"tt1294165","url":"http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/77854","votes":0,"rating":0.0,"certification":"","overview":"There have been many supposed ghost sightings at Crowley Hall in England. During its life, the hall has had a number of paranormal incidents suggesting the presence of ghosts, and there are ghost stories dating back to the 1950's. Recently, a ghost photo was recovered during renovations at the hall, and this prompted a full ghost investigation there. In early 2007, a small team of paranormal investigators led by Arron Kasady, entered the building to conduct some preliminary tests. Photographs were taken, that produced images of strange orbs in certain rooms, particularly the old children's nursery. Erratic temperature readings were recorded throughout the hall, and the team had the feeling of being constantly watched. The whole event was filmed and photographed for the documentary entitled 'The Ghosts of Crowley Hall'.","released":null,"posters":[{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"thumb","height":130,"width":92,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w92/vMcXEZrJ1BJWTihmFbqeiOfzg9f.jpg","id":"4eb1e5265e73d64f48000ab7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w154","height":217,"width":154,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w154/vMcXEZrJ1BJWTihmFbqeiOfzg9f.jpg","id":"4eb1e5265e73d64f48000ab7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"cover","height":261,"width":185,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w185/vMcXEZrJ1BJWTihmFbqeiOfzg9f.jpg","id":"4eb1e5265e73d64f48000ab7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"w342","height":482,"width":342,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/vMcXEZrJ1BJWTihmFbqeiOfzg9f.jpg","id":"4eb1e5265e73d64f48000ab7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"mid","height":704,"width":500,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/vMcXEZrJ1BJWTihmFbqeiOfzg9f.jpg","id":"4eb1e5265e73d64f48000ab7"}},{"image":{"type":"poster","size":"original","height":600,"width":426,"url":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/original/vMcXEZrJ1BJWTihmFbqeiOfzg9f.jpg","id":"4eb1e5265e73d64f48000ab7"}}],"backdrops":[],"version":1,"last_modified_at":"2012-02-20 19:12:59 UTC"}]
